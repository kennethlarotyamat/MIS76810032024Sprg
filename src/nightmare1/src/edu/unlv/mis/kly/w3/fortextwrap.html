    The role of IT in organizational innovation
    Stanislav Mamonov Richard Peterson
    
    Information technology is broadly recognized as an important element in organizational innovation. However, there has been relatively little integration of Information Systems research on the role of IT in organizational innovation. Such integration is particularly important in view of recent calls to examine the evolving ontological nature of IT, wherein IT artifacts are now shaping physical reality. We systematically examine innovation-related literature published in the leading IS journals in the period between 2009 and 2020 and identify and summarize the core theoretical discourses in this domain. We find that extant literature largely examines the role of IT in innovation at a high level of abstraction, focusing on IT investments and IT capabilities, and consequently precluding granular insights on who, what, when, where, how, and why in relation to organizational innovation. To address this limitation and to provide a structuring lens for future research, we develop the organizational innovation system framework which posits that actors, IT artifacts, actions, and organizational context are the key elements in organizational innovation systems that require more granular examination to yield deeper insights on how information technology contributes to organizational innovation. We re-examine the literature through the organizational innovation system lens and identify gaps in extant research. We also outline potential directions for expanding the scope of future research.
    
    Organizational innovation, defined as the design, invention, development and/or implementation of new or altered products, services, processes, systems, organizational structures, or business models, has been long recognized as an essential element of business strategy. Information technology plays an important role in supporting innovation within organizations, as well as being a component of innovative product and service offerings, and a conduit into new markets. While there is a growing body of literature examining the role of technology in supporting and enabling innovation across different organizational settings, there has been relatively little theoretical integration of research within this domain. Theoretical integration of extant research is a critical step in advancing theory development. The current effort is motivated by the following factors. First, there are several strands of organizational innovation-related research in Information Systems that evolved in parallel without integration across them. IT/business alignment, resource and capabilities-based perspectives, and business model innovation related research approach innovation from different theoretical foundations. Whereas research based on the resource-based view commonly focuses on IT resources, capabilities-based studies examine how managers are able to leverage IT resources, confounding the effects of IT resources and managerial actions.
    
    
    IT/business alignment research narrows the focus of inquiry to evaluating the alignment without explicit focus on either IT resources or managerial actions. Business model innovation research has largely treated IT systems as the context, focusing primarily on the governance and pricing issues related to IT-enabled platform business models. There has been little integration of recent insights across the different theoretical streams. Reviewed studies published prior to 2010 and concluded that much of the literature on IT-enabled innovation focused on internal organizational processes related to IT innovation development and implementation, while much less had been published on initiation of innovation efforts, commercialization of innovations, or the role of the external environment in innovation. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a systematic integration of literature on the role of IT in innovation published since 2010. The second motivation for the current review is the need to reassess the evolution of research on the role of IT in organizational innovation published since 2010 because of the growing transformative role of IT in innovation. Novel technologies are increasingly playing a generative role in shaping physical reality across different contexts that include business process automation enabled by artificial intelligence technologies, as well as AI-driven innovation that fundamentally reshape the role of information technology in innovation. Hence, there is a need to reassess and synthesize what is known about the role of IT in organizational innovation and identify directions for future research. This is echoed by Information Systems scholars who repeatedly noted that technology-enabled innovation is an important focal area for Information Systems. Integration of research on the role of information technology in innovation also has value for practitioners. The question of how firms can leverage information technology for innovation remains a challenge in practice. For example, artificial intelligence is the latest type of IT that promises to transform many industries. IDC reports that firms committed over $50 billion to AI investments in 2020 and investment is expected to grow to $110 billion by 2024. However, a recent survey of 3,000 executives conducted by Boston Consulting Group revealed that only 10% of the firms were able to realize a positive return from investments in artificial intelligence. A synthesis of literature will help practitioners better understand how IT can contribute to innovation within organizations. 
    
    
    
    
    The following research questions guide our effort. RQ1: Which theoretical perspectives are used to examine the role of IT in innovation at the organization-level of analysis in Information Systems? RQ2: What are the focal IT and innovation-related constructs in innovation research at the organization-level of analysis in Information Systems and how do they inform our knowledge about actors, activities, artifacts, and organizational factors involved in organizational innovation systems? RQ3: Where are gaps in extant literature from the organizational innovation system perspective and where are the most promising avenues for expanding the scope of research in this domain? To address our research questions, we conduct a systematic literature review and synthesize the key theoretical discourses in Information Systems on the role of information technology in innovation at the organization-level of analysis. We focus our analysis on studies published in the senior scholars’ basket of Information Systems journals in the twelve-year period that spans 2009–2020. These journals emphasize theoretical contribution as the key requirement for publication and therefore they serve as an appropriate lens into the core theoretical discourses on the role of information technology in innovation in Information Systems. We find that much of the extant research is developed on a narrow theoretical foundation of resource-based view and capabilities literature. Published studies are typically executed at a high level of abstraction and shed little light on the key actors, activities, or IT artifacts and their role in organizational innovation. Therefore, the key questions of who, what, when, where, how, and why in relation to the role of information technology in organizational innovation remain largely open. To address the need for a more granular view on the key IT-related factors that influence organizational innovation, we draw on innovation systems literature and we develop the organizational innovation system framework. The OIS framework posits that actors, activities, artifacts, and organizational factors are the key constituent components of an organizational innovation system. OIS serves as a theoretical lens that can frame future research and yield deeper, more nuanced, and more practice-relevant insights on the role of information technology in organizational innovation. 
    
    
    
    The OIS framework serves as an analysis-level theory and it focuses researchers’ attention on the need to understand how information technology affects and is affected by actors, activities, organizational factors, and how it ultimately affects organizational innovation. We reexamine the extant research through the OIS lens and we outline the opportunities for future research. Our study makes a number of contributions to theory and practice. First, we offer a synthesis of the core theoretical discourses in extant literature on the role of IT in organizational innovation. Second, we develop the organizational innovation system framework as an integrative theoretical lens on the role of information technology in organizational innovation. OIS lays the foundation for midrange theory development to begin to address questions of who, what, when, where, how, and why contribute to successful organizational innovation. Third, we identify the key actors, artifacts, actions and organizational context factors that have been examined in prior research and we provide a summary of known effects. Fourth, we outline gaps in extant knowledge and we also delineate directions for expanding the scope of research on the role of information technology in innovation. The remainder of the manuscript is structured as follows. In the next section, we provide an overview of organizational innovation and innovation system related research that guides the framing of our analysis. In the section that follows, we discuss the methodological approach underlying the selection and evaluation of the studies included in this review. In the next section, we present the analysis of the selected literature. We conclude with a discussion of the gaps in the current literature and potential future directions for impactful research. 
    
    
    
    Theoretical background Innovation and innovation types Our work focuses on the organization-level of analysis of innovation because businesses are the primary vehicles for developing and commercializing innovations. Globally, businesses spend an estimated $1.7 trillion dollars on research and development annually. To understand how information technology can affect innovation at the organization-level we adopt the Joshi et al. definition of organizational innovation as the “design, invention, development and/or implementation of new or altered products, services, processes, systems, organizational structures, or business models”. This definition covers both the innovation process as well as innovation outcomes. With the goal of identifying more coherent subgroups of organization-level innovation-related studies, we draw on several established typologies of innovation that distinguish 1) ideated versus commercialized, 2) internally versus externally focused, 3) incremental versus radical, and 4) closed versus open innovation. Ideated innovation is commonly associated with patents, i.e. formally recognized novel ideas with commercial potential. However, not all patents translate into commercial value for the innovating firms. Commercialized innovation refers to new products and/or services that generate profit for the innovating firms. Internally focused innovation aims at developing new ways of doing things within the organization, whereas externally focused innovation aims at developing new product or service offerings. The distinction between incremental versus radical innovation is determined in relation to the starting state. Whereas incremental innovations seek to add features or functionality to existing products or services, radical innovations are often discussed as disruptions within industries because they introduce fundamentally new products or services that reshape the markets. Internally focused radical innovations reshape value creation within the organizations, commonly offering substantial cost savings and scale benefits to the innovating organizations. Open innovation is distinguished from the traditional (closed) organizational innovation by the virtue of engagement of extraorganizational actors in the innovation process.
    
    
    
    The evolution of technology has made it easier for organizations to engage in open innovation via ideation platforms that are open to the public, as well as specialized tools for knowledge sharing with extra-organizational partners. Open innovation represents a fairly independent and voluminous stream of research that has been recently reviewed. Traditional (closed) innovation remains the dominant type of innovation within organizations. For these reasons, we are focusing our review on the traditional organizational innovation. We need to note that our literature review includes research on digital innovation. However, we do not focus on digital innovation conceptually because the concept of digital innovation suffers from theoretical ambiguity and potential definition tautology. Several substantially different definitions of digital innovation have been proposed. Whereas the early studies suggested a narrow definition of digital innovation as “the carrying out of new combinations of digital and physical components to produce novel products,” subsequent research introduced a much broader definition as “the use of digital technology during the process of innovating.” Defining digital innovation as “the use of digital technology during the process of innovating” suffers from definition tautology. Other authors offered their own definitions of digital innovation, focusing on the specific activities, e.g., “activities of initiating (triggers, opportunity identification, decision-making), developing (designing, developing, adopting), implementing (installing, maintaining, training, incentives), and exploiting (maximizing returns, leveraging existing systems/data for new purposes.” Themes in innovation research in Information Systems The role of technology in innovation is one of the central themes in Information Systems research. In fact, one might argue that nearly all IS studies at least tangentially inform about how technology influences innovation at different levels of analysis: individual, group, organizational, industry, and/or society. The focus of this review is on the role of IT in innovation at the organization-level of analysis. For this reason, we focus our discussion of prior literature on organization-level studies. There are at least four streams that are evident in this literature. The first stream focuses on how investments in IT affect organizational performance. 
    
    
    
    
    
    Studies in this stream are commonly framed from the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm which argues that possession of valuable, rare, hard to imitate and substitute resources provide a firm with a source of sustainable competitive advantage. Literature in this stream generally documents positive effects of IT investments, although some studies have challenged these results in the past. The second stream focuses on the IT/business alignment. This stream emerged from the observations that investments in IT resources do not always produce positive performance gains for the firms. The core argument of the literature in this stream is that in order to realize positive returns from IT investments, it is critical for the firms to align IT resources with the broader business strategy.
    
    As the thinking in strategic literature shifted from resources to capabilities, i.e., managerial ability to orchestrate resources to achieve organizational objectives, there was also a shift in IS research to examining how IT capabilities affect firm performance. Different conceptualizations of IT/IS capabilities have been proposed, but generally researchers find positive effects of IT/IS capabilities on organizational performance. The fourth stream of literature explores how IT innovations provide opportunities for new business models.
     
    
    
    
    
    This stream of literature examines a broad spectrum of questions that include the role of technology in the evolution of platform business models, as well as optimal technological and governance strategies associated with platform business models. The four streams outlined above have distinct conceptions of IT. Whereas IT investment and IS/business alignment literatures focus on IT resources, capabilities-based research examines IT/IS capabilities, therein confounding the effects of technology and technology management/orchestration. Business model innovation research has largely been focused on questions related to platform business models, treating IT artifact as the research context with only limited consideration of how technological factors influence platform innovation. Table 1 summarizes the key distinctions across the different stream of literature. In addition to examining the core discourses in extant literature, following the recommendations for conducting systematic literature reviews suggested by Par´e et al., we undertake synthesis across the research streams. Given the different conceptualizations of IT in extant research, synthesis requires a theoretical framework that affords the flexibility to integrate different theoretical perspectives within a single framework. Our choice of the integrative theoretical lens is informed by the guidance offered by Whetten that good theory needs to focus on concepts and the relationships among them and answer the questions of who, what, when, where, how, and why in relation to the phenomenon of interest. We are also mindful of the recent call to reintroduce the sociotechnical axis as the unifying concept in Information Systems research. Sociotechnical perspective emphasizes the importance of examining the dynamics of mutual effects of human actors and information technology on each other and it is at the foundation of Information Systems as a discipline. In the next section, we draw on prior research in innovation policy and technology innovation management and we develop the organizational innovation system framework. Innovation systems Innovation system perspective is grounded in the system and innovation concepts. The system concept posits that any system can be viewed as a set of components and relationships among them. System analysis focuses on defining system components and the relationships. Innovation system concept emerged in policy research focused on promoting innovation at the industry and country levels of analysis, wherein firms, universities, and government agencies are the key actors in the industry and country-level innovation efforts.
    
    
    
    
    Innovation system is defined as a set of components and causal relations influencing the generation and utilization of innovations and the innovative performance. Actors, activities, artifacts, and institutional context are the key components of an innovation system. Drawing on research in industry and country-level innovation systems, we define organizational innovation system as a set of components and the causal relations influencing the generation and utilization of innovations and the innovative performance of a firm. The key theoretical distinction of organizational innovation system stems from the focus on the firm as the unit of analysis. Consequently, there is a need to define the key actors, activities, artifacts, and organizational context factors that influence innovation at the organization-level. While identification of the previously researched organizational innovation system components is one of the goals of our review, here we will offer a preliminary discussion on the boundaries of these constructs. Focusing on actors within the organizational innovation systems, it is important to note that both employees of a firm, as well as external actors, e.g., customers and suppliers, can be involved in the innovation process. The engagement of extra-organizational actors in the innovation process is referred to as open innovation. Open innovation poses novel challenges in terms of structure and governance related to the external agent participation in the innovation process. Literature in management suggests that specific actors within organizations play important roles in organizational innovation. For example, prior research has shown that senior leadership that encompasses the CEO, as well as senior executives within a company, and the board of directors, can affect the organizational innovation performance. Among other factors, the CEO’s tolerance for change and the board’s professional diversity are significantly correlated with organizational innovation. In addition to the influence of individual actors, it would also be important to understand the influence of specific groups of actors. It is additionally important to recognize that groups may follow the organizational structure, but they may also represent informal associations of actors. While many different types of artifacts, e.g., product prototypes, may play a role in organizational innovation, our focus is on IT artifacts. In considering IT artifacts in the context of innovation systems, we must account for the use of IT in the innovation process, i.e., reliance on IT systems for opportunity scanning, ideation, and development, and 
    
    
    
    
    Commercialization of innovations. Among other findings, prior research documents a positive effect of ideation platform implementation on organizational innovation. We also must recognize situations wherein IT artifacts are a key part of an innovative product or service offering developed by a company. In the context of an organizational innovation system, focal activities are aimed at generation and utilization of innovations. Prior research in management notes that business process-related factors that cover a wide range of institutionalized processes that enable and support innovation-related activities can influence organizational innovation. Research in this area has shown that formalized market opportunity sensing and a systematic approach to market analysis can positively influence organizational innovation. Organizational context is comprised of internal and external components. Internal organizational context captures the elements of organizational structure, culture, and formal and informal governance mechanisms that can affect innovation-related activities. Innovation management literature suggests that, among other factors, organizational climate which is supportive of experimentation, and investment in employee development have positive effects on the innovation output of a firm. External organizational context includes environmental factors that are outside the organizational boundaries, such as the degree of competition and industry dynamism that are known to affect organizational innovation. Time is another important element in the consideration of the evolution of organizational innovation systems. Research in innovation management shows that the approach to innovation changes as young firms begin to mature. Actors, actions, artifacts, and organizational context will all evolve over time. The relationships among the components of the organizational innovation systems will also evolve over time. Understanding the feasible and optimal pathways of adaptation and evolution, as well as information technology-related factors that influence these processes would be an important consideration. Fig. 1 above outlines the theoretical framework that guides our synthesis of literature on the role of IT in organizational innovation. Methodology Literature reviews play a critical role in theory development. In developing this literature review, we follow the guidelines that outline the following steps in a systematic literature review process: 1) motivate the research topic, 2) describe the key concepts, 3) delineate the boundaries of research, 4) review prior literature, 5) present results, 6) develop a model
    
    
    
    
    
    
    for future research, 7) discuss theoretical and practical implications. This process is consistent with the more recent guidance on conducting systematic literature reviews. We also adhere to the recommendation for improving the transparency and reproducibility of published reviews by explicating inclusion and exclusion criteria in the selection of the literature for this review. Google Scholar returns over 3.5 million results for the “innovation and technology” search query. Given the overwhelming volume of research in this domain and following the recommendations, we focused this review on the research published in the senior scholars’ basket of Information Systems journals: Management Information Systems Quarterly (MISQ), Information Systems Research (ISR), Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS), Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS), European Journal of Information Systems (EJIS), Journal of Strategic Information Systems (JSIS), Information Systems Journal (ISJ), and Journal of Information Technology (JIT). These journals were selected because they emphasize theoretical contributions as a key consideration for publication and therefore these journals serve as an appropriate lens for identifying the core theoretical discourses in the published literature. To select the studies for the analysis, we searched the respective journals for articles containing the word “innovation” in either the title, the abstract, or the list of keywords published in the period between 2009 and 2020. We purposefully made the initial search through the literature very broad to make sure that we included all potentially-relevant studies in the analysis. We completed the article selection in December 2020, and we included manuscripts published early online to capture the most recent available research. Consequently, some of the studies in our sample were published in print after 2020. In aggregate, we retrieved 1612 manuscripts across the eight journals. In the next step, because our focus is on integrating original theoretical and empirical research, we excluded review articles and editorials from our analysis. We excluded open innovation-related research because this stream is relatively independent and it has been fairly recently reviewed. Next, we examined the remaining studies to determine the level of analysis in each. For this review, we selected only the studies at the organization-level of analysis. Following the recommendations for concept-focused systematic reviews and in alignment with RQ2 which focuses on what is known about the effects of IT on innovation, we excluded
    
    
    
    
    
     manuscripts that did not include innovation and at least one construct related to actors, activities, artifacts, or organizational context in the respective studies. Table 2 summarizes the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Filtering the selected sample of articles for the criteria outlined above left us with 91 empirical and theoretical studies that focus on the role of information technology in innovation at the organization level of analysis. Table 3 provides the counts of the retrieved and retained manuscripts from each journal.
    
    Analysis
    
    **Theoretical perspectives on the role of IT in innovation**
    
    In the first step of the analysis, we examined theoretical perspectives and focal IT and innovation-related constructs in the manuscripts published in the basket of eight senior scholars’ Information Systems journals. We find that studies focusing on innovation as an outcome generally follow a very different blueprint when compared to studies focusing on innovation as a process. Whereas outcome-focused studies tend to present empirical evaluation of elaborations on the established theories, much of the process-focused literature attempts to develop novel perspectives on innovation through case studies.
    
    The majority of the innovation outcome-focused studies are based on either the resource-based view (RBV) or the capabilities literature. Elaborations on RBV and capabilities are also observed in the form of a knowledge-based view of the firm and organizational learning theory, as well as a study leveraging agency theory to understand how contracting affects a firm’s ability to capture value from innovations. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the core constructs examined in RBV and capabilities-based literature. Summaries of insights associated with RBV and capabilities-based studies are provided in Appendixes A and B, respectively.
    
    We find a smaller set of studies that focus on innovation through the IT/business alignment and business model perspectives. Tables 6 and 7 summarize the IT/business alignment and business model-related studies respectively.
    
    **Focal IT and innovation-related constructs**
    
    Consistent with the dominant theoretical frames, we find that focal IT-related constructs in extant literature examine investment in IT assets/resources or IT-enabled capabilities. Examples include IT-enabled absorptive capacity and big data analytics capability. IT resources are typically treated as an aggregate construct without distinction between different types of IT resources. The studies by Kim et al. (2018) and Fay et al. (2018) are exceptions. Kim et al. (2018) examined the role of computing versus storage capacity in relation to firm performance. Fay et al. (2018) evaluated the effect of big data assets on firm
    
    
    
    
    productivity. Focusing on the innovation-related dependent variables in our sample, we find that many studies examine overall firm performance, typically measured as sales, firm value, and/or profitability. We also find studies focusing on ideation within an organization, patents, and new product development. Reviewing the trajectory of RBV-based theoretical discourse in the past 12 years, we find that the debate concerning the contribution of IT to business value has largely been settled. Research demonstrates that IT investments are associated with cost savings, cross-border collaboration, increase in patents, and an increase in firm value. Several studies focus on the effect of IT investments in concert with R&D investments and find a positive interaction effect of IT and R&D investments. The positive interaction effect of IT and R&D is enhanced in turbulent industry environments. Researchers are increasingly focusing on the role of organizational factors in influencing the return on IT investments. Corporate diversification strategy is associated with greater returns on IT investments. A proactive environmental strategy is a positive moderator of the effect of IT investments on firm value. More recent studies find that some organizational factors may undermine the realization of value from IT investments. Misaligned organizational posture can lower the return on IT investment.
    
    Examining the discourse on the role of IT capabilities in innovation, we find more than twenty conceptualizations of IT capabilities that vary broadly in specificity and granularity. Some researchers focus on specific technical capabilities, such as cloud capability, whereas others examine more people-focused capabilities, such as IT competence and IS technical skills. We also find studies focusing on IT management capabilities that are conceptualized as
    
    
    either general IT management capability or more specific variants, such as IS project portfolio management and IT application orchestration. Conceptualizations of IT-enabled organizational capabilities include operational capability, improvisational capability, and IT-enabled absorptive capacity. Recently, the concept of harmonious information technology affordance has been introduced, capturing IT-enabled collaborative, organizational memory, and process management affordances.
    
    The IT/business alignment literature in our research frame demonstrates a progression from showing generally positive effects of IT/business alignment on firm performance to resolving some contradictory results in the literature by differentiating between firm- and process-level conceptualizations of IT/business alignment. The latest research in this stream examines the effect of maintaining IT/business alignment through the IT lifecycle from planning to implementation and shows that maintaining the alignment throughout the IT lifecycle is critical for firm performance.
    
    Despite the potential transformative role of emergent information technologies on business models, we find only two studies in our research frame that examined any aspects of information technology-related actors, artifacts, or actions. One study contributes to the digital entrepreneurship debate on whether business opportunities are created or recognized by entrepreneurs and finds that the opportunity creation perspective better reflects observations in the context of a cloud-based game developer. Another study examines business models across a panel of application programming interface (API) vendors and develops a typology of dominant business models associated with API-based services.
    
    Process-focused, innovation-related research in our sample, without exception, leverages case studies to evaluate extant theories as well as to develop novel theoretical ideas. For example, a case study of a rural telehealth initiative in India suggests that neither path dependency nor contingency theories fully capture the path of the initiative. The authors propose a "path constitution" perspective that recognizes some path-related dependencies while also acknowledging the generative nature of the innovation process as a better theoretical frame for understanding how innovative organizations evolve. Process-oriented
    
    
    
     studies note that more established firms often take a measured approach to implementing innovations within organizations (Henfridsson and Bygstad, 2013), whereas startups emphasize rapid data-driven innovation as the core mode of operation (Huang et al., 2017). Appendix D summarizes the key insights that emerged from the process-focused research in our sample. Native IS theories In our sample, we find one manuscript that develops a novel IS theory. Ning and Tanriverdi (2017) address the question of how ITenabled capabilities affect firm response to environmental hyperturbulence. The authors examine this question through agent-based modeling and they argue that while external IT-driven innovations can be a source of environmental hyperturbulence, internal ITenabled capabilities can support an effective firm response through IT-enabled innovation. Research on the role of IT in innovation through the organizational innovation system lens Applying the organizational innovation system framework and focusing on the key actors examined in prior research, we find only four studies that examined the roles of specific actors in organizational innovation in our review frame. Leidner et al. (2010) studied innovation among hospitals and found that CIO strategic leadership was a key factor in innovation. Kim et al. (2011) surveyed Korean firms and found that IT personnel expertise was positively correlated with firms’ innovation. Benlian and Haffke (2016) surveyed German senior executives and found that CIOs’ perception of IT/business alignment was positively associated with the CEOs’ perception of IT contribution to business performance. Tumbas et al. (2018) explored how chief digital officers (CDOs) performed their roles within organizations and found that CDOs developed novel organizational logics to support their function. Focusing on IT artifacts in our review frame, we find that Kim et al. (2011) reported a positive association between IT infrastructure flexibility and firm performance. These results were echoed by Chen et al. (2014). Grisot et al. (2014) reported a positive association between IT architecture flexibility and innovative use of IT. Kim et al. (2018) found a positive correlation between the number of servers and firm performance, while also finding a negative correlation between the reported storage capacity and organizational performance. Fay et al. (2018) documented a 3–7 percent improvement in firm productivity associated with big data asset ownership. Examining specific activities noted in prior research, we find that IT management (Kim et al., 2011), business process integration, and strategic alignment of IT with business functions (Chen et al., 2014) are positively correlated with firm performance. De Vaujany et al. (2013) report that socialization and development of novel IT artifacts requires demonstrations at trade shows, solicitation of customer feedback, and iterative artifact development. Dong and Yang (2019) found that greater use of IT is associated with a higher number of patents awarded to a firm. Innovative use of IT is also reported associated with greater volume and diversity of ideas for
    
    organizational innovation (Roberts et al., 2016). Barua and Mani (2018) examined the effects of IT outsourcing announcements on firm value and found that IT outsourcing announcements have a positive effect on firm value in mature industries. Focusing on the role of internal organization context, we find that firm size affects a firm’s ability to create value through IT investments. Hitt and Tambe (2012) show that larger firms are able to realize greater value from IT investments. Leidner et al. (2010) find that organizational climate is an important factor that affects IT innovation within organizations. Fichman and Melville (2014) explored the role of organizational innovation posture on the firm’s ability to realize value from IT investments and found that innovation posture was associated with higher return on investment. These results are echoed by Ravichandran (2018) who found that IT investment orientation was positively correlated with firm performance. Dhaliwal et al. (2011) studied factors that affect IT sub-unit alignment with organizational goals and found that effective governance (standards and processes) was essential in producing IT/ business alignment. Street et al. (2018) showed that organizational posture is an important influencer of organizational entrepreneurial action. Svahn et al. (2017) found that collaboration and governance mechanisms can help reduce inter-organizational conflict and foster innovation development. Table 8 summarizes the key constructs analyzed in prior research. Discussion Dominant theories and their limitations In our analysis of the dominant theories in our sample, we find that resource-based view and capabilities theories are the most cited theoretical frameworks in Information Systems research focused on innovation. RBV argues that rare, valuable, hard to imitate and to substitute resources offer a competitive advantage to the firms that possess them (Barney, 1995; Barney et al., 2011). The capabilities literature builds on RBV and posits that it is not just the resources, but rather what organizations do with the resources that gives firms an advantage (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Teece et al., 1997). The appeal of both RBV and dynamic capabilities perspectives is that it is relatively easy to instrument both the predictors and the dependent variables in the empirical assessments of the frameworks. Despite their appeal, both RBV and dynamic capabilities theories have significant weaknesses. RBV has a problem with potential tautology of the argument (Priem and Butler, 2001). The valuable aspect of the resource evaluation requires the benefit of hindsight to know which resources would prove valuable in the context of continually evolving industries. The value of resources is hard to assess before disruptions occur (Priem and Butler, 2001). For example, Polaroid and Kodak held many valuable resources (technology, patents, brand recognition, marketing channels, etc.), yet the companies were unable to realize the asset value potential with the emergence of the digital cameras, which, in turn, lost much of the 
    
    market to smart phone manufacturers (Lucas and Goh, 2009; Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000). The capabilities theory inherits the weakness of the RBV argument. Capabilities are typically instrumented as managerial perceptions of organizational competencies (Gu and Jung, 2013). It is difficult to know which capabilities would prove advantageous without knowing the next stage in the evolution of specific markets and industries. One might expect that innovation capability, i.e. the ability of a firm to develop technical innovations, would be highly advantageous, yet we find cases of companies that had spectacularly failed to commercialize their innovations. Xerox PARC developed many of the core innovations in modern computing, e.g., the graphical user interface, laser printing, and Ethernet network technologies, yet the company largely failed to monetize these innovations (Chesbrough, 2002). More recently, Yahoo was an early leader in the big data analytics domain, yet the company generally failed to monetize its capabilities, and Yahoo’s technical innovations and talent were absorbed by other firms (Schmarzo, 2013). Organizational ambidexterity is often cited as a critical capability for incumbent firms (Leidner et al., 2011). The ambidexterity argument posits that incumbent firms must simultaneously excel in exploitation and exploration, i.e. extracting value from existing lines of business, as well as continually engaging in innovation (Raisch and Birkinshaw, 2008). While appealing, the ambidexterity argument similarly suffers from the same tautological weakness that affects RBV. Innovation carries inherent uncertainty and therefore it is difficult to have confidence that an organization is engaged in innovation that can assure future performance. Recent empirical evidence from manufacturing firms casts doubt on the very premise of the ambidexterity thesis. Haus-Reve et al. (2019) find that parallel investments in supply-chain optimization (value maximization from current business) and R&D (innovation) produce a negative interaction effect in relation to the financial performance of the studied firms. In addition to suffering from the tautology issues, RBV and capabilities-based perspectives have one other key limitation. Both theories approach understanding of the key factors that influence organizational performance from a very high level of abstraction. Studies on the role of information technology that adopted RBV as the theoretical foundation typically focus on IT investments as the main independent variable. IT investments can encompass IT personnel (who), IT artifacts (what), IT management practices (how), thus precluding the opportunity for more granular insights into IT-related factors that can influence organizational innovation. Capabilities-based literature, similarly, often instruments the key independent factor as either a general high-level IT capability, or a slightly more focused construct, e.g., information processing capability. Instrumented this way, the studies also yield limited insight on the who, what, and how in relation to the effects of information technology on organizational innovation. Reassessing extant research through the organizational innovation system lens To address the limitations of RBV and capabilities-based perspectives, we have introduced the organizational innovation system framework. We draw on the innovation system literature that was developed at the industry and country levels of analysis (Granstrand and Holgersson, 2020) and we argue that understanding actors, IT artifacts, actions, internal and external organizational context, as well as potential external innovation partners can yield much richer theoretical insights that would also afford a greater degree of practical relevance by answering the questions of who, what, when, where, how, and why in relation to the role of information technology in organizational innovation. An examination of extant literature through the organizational innovation system lens reveals a number of gaps. Gap 1: Limited knowledge on the key actors who contribute to organizational innovation We found only four studies that examined the role of specific actors in organizational innovation. The extant research highlights the importance of the CIO and CDO roles within organizations (Benlian and Haffke, 2016; Leidner et al., 2010; Tumbas et al., 2018). Kim et al. (2011) reported a positive association between IT personnel expertise and firm innovation. As we noted in the introductory discussion of different actors that may be involved in organizational innovation, it is important to examine both individual actors and groups. We have hints of the importance of specific groups in extant literature. For example, Svahn et al. (2017) examined the development of the connected car initiative at Volvo and found instances of group conflict that hindered the introduction of novel technologies. Arvidsson and Mønsted (2018) observed similar patterns while studying introduction of digital technologies in a Norwegian hospital wherein the group promoting the use of new technologies needed to carefully navigate the rollout to avoid intergroup conflict. Notably, whereas the Volvo cases focuses on formally defined groups (Svahn et al., 2017), the case presented by Arvidsson and Mønsted (2018) illustrates the importance of informal groups. Additional research would be needed to better understand individual contribution of key IT personnel to organizational innovation as well as how IT groups can effectively collaborate with other organizational units. Gap 2: Limited knowledge on how specific IT artifacts can contribute to organizational innovation The extant literature on the effects of information technology on innovation, with only a few exceptions, has treated IT investments as a high-order construct that does not afford much visibility into what is actually affected: IT personnel, IT assets, IT-enabled activities, etc. IT investments can cover a very broad spectrum of technologies. Importantly, new types of IT systems evolve rapidly. However, IT systems in themselves may not create value. Value is created through IT use that often involves adaptive structuration, i.e. adaptation and expansion of system use for novel purposes (Desanctis and Scott, 1994; Schmitz et al., 2016). We find relatively few studies that examined specific types of IT systems or IT-enabled capabilities in our analysis of the IS literature on innovation. Fay et al. (2018) study on the effects of big data assets on firm productivity is one of only a few exceptions. The authors found a positive relationship between ownership of big data assets and firm productivity. However, even big data assets span a very broad spectrum of data resources ranging from social media to medical imaging data and industrial sensor data. Different types of big data assets likely present different opportunities and challenges in innovation, value creation and value capture. Therefore, a more granular approach is 
    
    needed to understand how different types and aspects of technology can influence organizational innovation. Gap 3: Limited knowledge on activities that enable organizations to leverage IT artifacts for organizational innovation Extant research offers fairly limited insight on the actions that can contribute to organizational innovation. IT management and strategic alignment of IT with business functions have been shown to be positively associated with firm performance (Chen et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2011). Innovative use of IT has been shown to be associated with greater volume and diversity of ideas for organizational innovation (Roberts et al., 2016). However, Barua and Mani (2018) have also shown that investors react positively to announcements of IT outsourcing by firms operating in mature industries. These results leave many open questions. For example, What exactly constitutes effective IT management? and How can firms decide on which IT functions to outsource without undermining the potential for innovation? Gap 4: Limited knowledge on internal organizational context factors that can influence organizational innovation Published studies document the importance of organizational innovation stance and IT investment orientation as factors that influence organizational performance (Fichman and Melville, 2014; Ravichandran, 2018; Street et al., 2018). Svahn et al. (2017) have shown that organizational governance mechanisms are important for fostering innovation. While these high-level findings generally support the importance of the internal organizational context, they provide little in the way of actionable guidance for practitioners. How do organizations develop an effective innovation stance? and How to they leverage IT artifacts to support the organizational innovation imperative? remain largely open questions. Several case studies that examined how innovations evolve within organizations find that sometimes employees find a path toward permeating innovations despite the lack of formal organizational support mechanisms (Arvidsson and Mønsted, 2018; Svahn et al., 2017). It would be important to understand how organizations can support and capture value from this type of “bottom-up” innovation. Gap 5: Limited knowledge on how IT contributes to different types of innovation Much of the published research measures innovation at a very high level. The majority of outcome-focused IS literature in our sample is relying on firm performance measures (productivity, sales, profitability, value added) or firm value (stock returns, return on investment) to measure innovation. These measures, while being a good gage of the overall firm performance, do not necessarily measure innovation per se. Firms can improve productivity, sales, profitability, firm value and generate returns with existing products without any innovation. This can be accomplished, for example, by selling more of existing products or services and enjoying the benefits from the economies of scale. Few authors have attempted to untangle the contribution of innovative products and/or services from the coarse financial performance measures. We also find studies focusing on patents as a measure of innovation. Patents are a challenging measure in that while patents may be a good proxy for ideated innovations, they do not necessarily capture commercialized innovations (Mansfield, 1986). An analysis of innovation measurement in management journals has found 86 different measures of innovations in management literature and concluded that it is difficult to reconcile the insights related to innovation that are collected using different measurements (Adams et al., 2006). A similar challenge affects the IS literature. Given the current coarse measures of innovation in IS literature, it is challenging to make recommendations on exactly how firms should approach leveraging IT for innovation. Gap 6: Lack of knowledge on the interaction between IT and organizational factors Our analysis of IS research on the role of IT in innovation reveals that publications largely overlook organizational factors. Technology-driven innovation is inherently a sociotechnical phenomenon and the key gap that is evident in extant literature is the lack of consideration of joint effects of technology-related and organizational factors in innovation. While prior research has generally found positive effects of IT investment on firm performance, it would be important to examine how firm leadership, managerial levers, and business processes interact with IT investments to create innovation and value for the firm. Prior studies in management literature have demonstrated important effects of founders (Lee et al., 2020), family ownership (Kotlar et al., 2020), board diversity (Li, 2019), individual employee experience and capabilities (Kaiser et al., 2018; Schubert and Tavassoli, 2019), and R&D restructuring decisions (Buenstorf and Costa, 2018) among other factors that may influence innovation within firms. It would be important to examine the interaction of these and other organizational factors with IT-related constructs in influencing innovation. Research priorities Re-evaluation of extant research on the role of information technology on organizational innovation through the organizational innovation system lens reveals that research published to date affords fairly limited insights on the effects of information technology, actors, activities, and the organizational context. This presents the question of priorities in terms of addressing the gaps in our knowledge vis-` a-vis the organizational innovation system framework. We argue that gaps 2, 1, and 6 that focus on the information technology, actors, and the interplay between IT and social factors are central to advancing Information Systems theory and aligning the research on the role of information technology in organizational innovation with the calls for reintroducing the sociotechnical perspective as the unifying theme in IS research (Sarker et al., 2019). These priorities would also be consistent with the recent discussion of the continued need for deeper theorizing of information technology artifacts (digital objects) that noted that IT artifacts necessarily acquire “social identity” through use (Faulkner and Runde, 2019). The rapidly emergent applications of artificial intelligence in business strategy offer a particularly fertile ground for exploring the role of information technology contribution to organizational innovation through the OIS lens because this is a growing area in practice (McKinsey, 2020)
    
    Opportunities for future research In addition to the gaps in extant literature that we outlined in the previous section, we also see an opportunity to expand the scope of questions that are being examined and enrich the theoretical base in research on the effects of information technology on innovation to pursue the “blue ocean” strategy (Straub, 2009). Opportunity 1: Explore the role of IT in disruptive innovations Disruptive innovations, i.e. innovations that fundamentally reshape markets and industries, pose the biggest challenge to incumbent firms. Christensen (1997) noted that disruptive innovations are often initially ignored by incumbent firms because many disruptive innovations in the early stages of development are objectively inferior to the incumbent firm’s offerings. Recent empirical research in the hospitality industry suggests that incumbent firm managers often perceive disruptors as lacking legitimacy and tend to ignore the disruptors in the early stages of development (Weber et al., 2019). However, innovators often evolve over time into new dominant players in the respective markets, thus disrupting the incumbent businesses. Understanding how early stage disruptors approach leveraging IT for innovation would be beneficial for both startups and incumbent firms and it represents a very attractive area for future research. Opportunity 2. Explore differences between high-growth ventures versus established firms Another important opportunity stems from the relative lack of research on high-growth ventures. We find only one study focusing on innovation in high-growth ventures in our sample. Huang et al. (2017) examined the innovation process in a Chinese fintech company and found that the innovation process was data-driven and focused on rapid release of new features. These results are in marked contrast with the literature that focused on innovation within mature firms (Arvidsson and Mønsted, 2018; Svahn et al., 2017). There is certainly an opportunity to examine how startups and later stage high-growth firms across different industries approach innovation to better understand the role of technology in enabling and supporting innovation at different stages of organizational maturity. Opportunity 3: Examine the effects of the external organizational context (level of competition, industry dynamism, regulation) on innovation development There has been relatively little research in Information Systems on the role of the industry environment in IT-enabled innovation. We find several studies in management literature that point to the important role of the competitive environment and business cycle in innovation. Bessonova and Gonchar (2019) analyzed competition among manufacturing firms and found that a modest level of competition stimulates innovation, whereas a high level of competition depresses innovation across all firms. Silvestri et al. (2018) found that economic downturns offer an opportunity to realize greater value from unconventional investments in technology. It would be of interest to examine how the competition and business cycles affect IT-enabled innovation as well as innovations wherein IT is an integral part of the innovation outcome. Opportunity 4: Explore the contribution of IT to product/service tangibility Whereas prior research in IS suggested a dichotomy of product versus service firms (Lusch and Nambisan, 2015), management scholars have recognized that product-service represents a continuum. Alexiev et al. (2018) drew on the socio-technical theory and examined how product/service tangibility affects managers’ approach to innovation. The authors found that low tangibility was associated with innovation focus on customer service, whereas high tangibility was associated with greater technology focus. Sjodin ¨ et al. (2020) examined successful and unsuccessful attempts to transition from product to service businesses and found that firms often fail in the value provision and value-in-use delivery. These findings open a potential new avenue for IS research to identify technologyrelated factors that influence both tangibility of the final product/service offered by a firm as well as to better understand the challenges and opportunities associated with the transition from product to service offerings in innovative IT-enabled industries. Opportunity 5: Examine lessons from failures While innovation is an essential element of business strategy, innovation is also inherently risky in that innovation effort failures are common (D’Este et al., 2016). There is a growing body of literature in management journals focusing on how innovation failure affects managerial decisions and overall firm performance. For example, Hermosilla (2020) finds that pharmaceutical companies tend to realize less value after acquiring patents following their own R&D failures. The authors attribute this effect to potential cognitive biases that affect managerial decisions. Kapoor and Klueter (2020) find that research project setbacks in pharmaceutical industry often lead to reductions in research funding across the industry. Learning from innovation project failures with the goal of avoiding pitfalls in the future, but also increasing the likelihood of future innovation project success is another potential promising avenue for IS scholars. Opportunity 6: Explore the industry convergence phenomenon Recent management studies have shown that evolution of patents over time is predictive of industry convergence (Sick et al., 2019). It is apparent that IT has been a catalyst in the industry convergence trend. Technology-driven companies have become global business leaders. Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (Google), and Facebook claim four of the top five spots in the rankings of the most valuable global companies (Desjardins, 2019). Amazon is number two on the list and while the company currently derives most of its revenue from the retail business, its digital business (Amazon Web Services) is responsible for more than 63% of its operating profit (Amazon, 2020). These facts reflect the ever-growing permeation of technology in different facets of human activity and the commercial opportunities 
    
    created by the technologies. Technology-driven innovation is creating tremendous business value. Leading technology companies are continually expanding the scope of their efforts to enter into new industries. Amazon has expanded into grocery retail and is considering starting a health insurance division (Amazon, 2020). Alphabet (Google) has an even broader innovation project portfolio that spans the range of smart home technologies as well as self-driving cars and health informatics (Alphabet, 2020). These observations are indicative of a broader trend of industry convergence. IT-related factors are very likely to influence industry convergence trends. It is important to understand how incumbents can react to potential new competition that emerges from outside a given industry. Management literature has noted that it is possible for incumbent firms to be effective innovators. Onufrey and Bergek (2019) found that established mature firms can be innovators in both process and product categories. Garms and Engelen (2019) found that greater CTO structural power is associated with greater innovation. Future IS research can examine both technology and social factors that influence industry convergence trends and develop strategy recommendations for both new entrants and incumbent firms. Opportunity 7: The role of diversity in innovation Diversity is recognized as an important element that affects innovation (Hewlett et al., 2013; Østergaard et al., 2011). Recent research in management journals has shown that gender diversity among the top-management team has a positive effect on firm performance (Triana et al., 2019). Xie et al. (2020) find a positive effect of gender diversity on innovation efficiency in Chinese firms. Prior IS literature has examined the effects of cultural background and gender on IS career trajectories (Igbaria and Baroudi, 1995; Igbaria and Wormley, 1992) and there is an opportunity to expand the understanding on the role of diversity in IT-driven innovation. Contribution to theory Our study makes a number of contributions to theory. First, while the role of information technology in organizational innovation is broadly recognized (Nambisan et al., 2020a, 2014; Yoo et al., 2010), research in this domain evolved in several parallel streams without substantial integration across them. The most recent review on the role of information technology in organizational innovation focused on literature published prior to 2010 (Kohli and Melville, 2019). Cross-theoretic knowledge integration is essential in advancing theory development (Rivard, 2020, 2014). We offer a synthesis of the core theoretical discourses in extant literature on the role of IT in organizational innovation. We find that much of the published research is grounded in a narrow theoretical base of resource-based (Barney, 1995, 2001; Wade and Hulland, 2004) and capabilities-based (Teece and Pisano, 1994; Teece, 2007; Teece et al., 1997) perspectives. Both of these theories have substantial limitations in 1) tautology of the theoretical argument (Priem and Butler, 2001) and 2) high-level of abstraction of the core concepts that offer only limited insights for practice. To address the limitations of RBV and capabilities perspectives and to facilitate cross-theoretic integration, we develop the organizational innovation system framework as an integrative theoretical lens on the role of information technology in organizational innovation. We draw on innovation system research and we argue that understanding actors, IT artifacts, actions, and organizational context would yield a richer set of theoretical insights that would also offer a higher degree of practice-relevant insights. OIS serves as analysis-level theory that will focus researchers’ attention on the key elements that influence organizational innovation (Gregor, 2006) and it lays the foundation for mid-range theory development to begin to address questions of who, what, when, where, how, and why contribute to successful organizational innovation (Gregor, 2006; Whetten, 1989). This is our second contribution to theory. Our third contribution to theory is the identification of the key actors, artifacts, actions and organizational context factors that have been examined in prior research. We find that prior research has shown that IT leadership (Benlian and Haffke, 2016; Leidner et al., 2010) as well as IT personnel expertise (Kim et al., 2011) are positively correlated with firm performance. We also found several studies showing that IT infrastructure flexibility can be an important element in organizational innovation (Chen et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2011). IT management (Kim et al., 2011), innovative use of IT (Roberts et al., 2016), and development of novel organizational logics (Tumbas et al., 2018) have been highlighted as the key activities that can influence organizational performance. Organizational climate (Leidner et al., 2010), innovation posture (Fichman and Melville, 2014), collaboration and governance mechanisms (Svahn et al., 2017) have been shown as important organizational context factors that influence firm performance. In aggregate these results support the validity and relevance of OIS as a comprehensive, yet parsimonious framework to guide future research on the role of information technology in organizational innovation (Gregor, 2006; Whetten, 1989). Although we found a number of studies that addressed several components of the organizational innovation system framework, we have not found a comprehensive examination of all the elements. We outline gaps in extant knowledge from the OIS perspective and we also delineate a number of directions for expanding the scope of research on the role of information technology in innovation. This is our fourth contribution to theory. Limitations No research is without limitations and we need to note several limitations in this literature review as well. Due to the overwhelming volume of research on innovation, we focused our review only on the top eight Information Systems journals. While these journals emphasize theoretical contribution as the key consideration for publishing and typically represent a good sampling frame for the current theoretical discourses in Information Systems, we cannot exclude the possibility that we may have overlooked theoretically important intellectual contributions that were published in journals other than those that we included in this review. We also need to note the inherent limitation of the OIS framework as an analysis-level theory (Gregor, 2006). Analysis-level theories “do not extend beyond analysis and description, no causal relationships among phenomena are specified and no predictions are made” (Gregor, 2006). While OIS posits that actors, actions, artifacts, and organizational context are the core components
    
    of an organizational innovation system, the framework does not offer specific causal relationships among them. Fawcett & Downs (1986) argued that descriptive theories are appropriate when relatively little is known about the phenomenon in question. Our reanalysis of extant literature on the role of information technology in organizational innovation revealed fairly limited number of studies that examined specific actors, actions, artifacts and organizational context factors to date. Hence, we believe the analysis-level theory is appropriate at this stage to guide future research that would focus on identify causal linkages among IT and the OIS components in influencing organizational innovation. Conclusion This literature review was motivated by a relatively abundant body of research on the role of IT in innovation across several theoretical streams, but limited integration of published research in this field. To address the lack of integration in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review and we examined innovation-related research published in the leading Information Systems Journals in the period between 2009 and 2020. We find that studies in our sample of IS manuscripts are generally rooted in a fairly narrow theoretical base of resource-based view of the firm and capabilities theories. We also find that while many studies have demonstrated positive effects of IT on innovation (Chwelos et al., 2009; Dewan and Ren, 2011; Havakhor et al., 2019; Kleis et al., 2012), more recent literature is suggesting diminishing returns from IT investments (Ravichandran et al., 2017a, 2017b) and less impact from IT investments in less technical sectors of the economy (Fay et al., 2018). Answering the calls for a reexamination on the role of information technology in innovation (Baskerville et al., 2020) and following the recommendations for theory development in systematic literature reviews (Okoli, 2015; Par´e et al., 2015; Webster and Watson, 2002), we developed the organizational innovation system framework as a theoretical lens to facilitate cross-theoretic integration of extant research. We argue that OIS offers a more granular focus on actors, IT artifacts, activities, and organizational context that will produce a richer set of theoretical insights with greater relevance for practice (Straub and Ang, 2011). Re-examination of studies within our research frame revealed that there is limited knowledge across nearly all components of the organizational innovation system framework. While prior research has recognized the key role of CIOs, CDOs, IT architecture flexibility, and IT/business alignment in organizational innovation, many questions remain open. We identify the key gaps in extant research and we also outline a number of opportunities in expanding the scope of future research in this domain.
