    information technology affordance on

organisational innovation
Abstract

In this study, we investigate the nature of the influence of

organisational information technology (IT) on innovation. To

examine this relationship, we leverage a fundamental con-

struct: harmonious IT affordance (HITA). HITA is defined as

the degree of coalignment between three salient organisa-

tional IT affordances, each of which allows an organisation to

carry out its most fundamental functions using IT
—
collabora-

tion, maintenance of organisational memory, and management

of organisational processes. We theorize that HITA has a qua-

dratic (U-shaped) effect on innovation. Our theory proposes

that when IT affordances increasingly co-align (reflected by

increasing HITA), the organisation enters a synergistic, virtu-

ous phase that encourages innovation. Counterintuitively, the

increasing misalignment of IT affordances can also result in

organisational
innovation
via
creative
dissonance,
which

enables organisations to look for opportunities in the pres-

ence of misalignment and leverage it to create a synergistic

virtuous cycle. We conducted two empirical studies
—
one with

high-level IT executives knowledgeable about innovation and

one with sales and business development executives (who

market innovations) knowledgeable about IT
—
that corrobo-

rate our theory. Crucially, if the IT affordances are unrelated

(low coalignment, where HITA is close to zero), then innova-

tion does not take place. We thus surmise that the relation

between HITA and innovation is quadratic.

N T RO DU CT I O N

Organisational innovation has long been and continues to be, a major focus of academic research on management

and organisations (Dong et al., 2017; Funk, 2014).
Innovation
can be defined as
“
any novel product, service, or pro-

duction process that departs significantly from prior product, service, or production process architectures
”
(McKinley

et al., 2014, p. 91). Notably,
“
innovation has become the Holy Grail for many organisations
”
(Alexander & Van

Knippenberg, 2014, p. 423) because it is critical for organisations to maintain competitive advantage (Crossan &

Apaydin, 2010). Therefore, researchers in the fields of management, information systems (IS) and strategy have long

sought to understand the relationship between IT and organisational innovation (in this paper,
innovation
and

organisational innovation
are used interchangeably).

An organisation's information technology (IT) has often been argued to play a crucial role in innovation (Yoo

et al., 2012; Ravichandran et al., 2017). The prominent view forwarded by such studies on IT and innovation is

that IT strongly affects innovation (eg, Kohli & Grover, 2008; Schryen, 2013; Yoo et al., 2012). Research on IT and

innovation is a rich body of work and many researchers have offered nuanced and qualified results on how IT and

innovation are related (eg, Müller et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2016).

A growing body of observations claim that the IT
à
innovation link is nonlinear (El Sawy et al., 2010; Grewal

et al., 2001; Oh & Pinsonneault, 2007). Innovation is often characterised by far-reaching organisational changes

(Girod & Whittington, 2015) caused by disruptive technologies (Lucas & Goh, 2009). Often, such changes do not

strictly follow a linear pattern. For example, digital products tend to have cascading effects that result in unforeseen

and often nonlinear pathways to innovation (Yoo, 2010). Similarly, studies have also claimed that the institutionalisation

of innovation follows a nonlinear process (Nielsen et al., 2014). Organisational variables generate complex, nonlinear

dynamics in which the phenomena of knowledge creation and dissemination, both of which are essential to innovation,

behave nonlinearly (Garud & Kumaraswamy, 2005). In fact, in the digitised world, a linear causality has been criticised

as being inadequate, highlighting the idea that the influence of IT on innovation is nonlinear:

Such a linear view of causation remains limited and inadequate for explaining increased nonlinear

interactions in digitized environments with processes such as coevolution, emergence, and self-

organisations
...
(Benbya et al., 2020, p. 9).

However, despite observations that IT's influence on innovation is nonlinear, most empirical investigations of IT

and innovation
—
especially those in the
quantitative, deductive
tradition
—
assume implicitly or explicitly that the rela-

tionship between IT and innovation is linear (eg, Chatterjee et al., 2015; Rahrovani & Pinsonneault, 2020; Saldanha

et al., 2017, 2020; Tarafdar & Tanriverdi, 2018; Xue et al., 2012). Although these studies provide deep insights into

the nature of IT-enabled innovation, a focus on the nonlinear relationship between IT and innovation would augment

their findings and enrich our understanding of IT-enabled innovation.

Two fairly recent reviews of innovation research in IS (Jha & Bose, 2016; Kohli & Melville, 2019) support our

contention that a nonlinear treatment of the relationship between IT and innovation is practically absent in extant

quantitative research on innovation.

This is consistent with the broader observation that
“
research in most

[IS] areas has focused on linear effects
”
(Brown et al., 2012, p. 485). Understandably, nonlinear effects are challenging

[predominantly linear] assumptions and achieve analytical tractability
”
(Meyer et al., 2005, p. 470). We propose that

the pervasive assumptions and prevalence of linearity in quantitative IS research on innovation may be unwarranted,

especially in view of emerging evidence that innovations are essentially nonlinear phenomena (Nambisan et al., 2017).

We thus suggest that it is valuable to conceptualise (and test) the nonlinear nature of the IT
à
innovation relation.

Formally, a nonlinear causal relation exists when the effect does not proportionately
—
directly or inversely
—

change with the cause (Meyer et al., 2005). Theorising phenomena by using the lens of nonlinearity has multiple ben-

efits. For example, it allows researchers to better understand the sensitivity of the output to the input (Yang

et al., 2013). In fact, investigations of nonlinearity offer complex and dynamic insights into the relations between

inputs and outputs, particularly in terms of incremental effects of change in one on the other. Such knowledge con-

sequently allows organisations to optimise their strategy and their inputs in view of a desired output (Yang

et al., 2013). Researchers have accordingly cautioned that not proposing or testing for nonlinear relations may lead

to spurious conclusions and misleading interpretations (Haans et al., 2016; Titah & Barki, 2009).
2
Consequently,

researchers have been urged to make use of nonlinear empirical techniques (eg, Brown et al., 2012). For innovation

studies, researchers have specifically called for using nonlinear perspectives to clarify the sensitivity of organisational

innovation to IT (Bharadwaj et al., 2013); moreover, if there is a compelling reason or justification for nonlinearity,

then the recommendation is that it should be investigated first (Klein et al., 2009). Answering such calls, we develop

a nonlinear theory of the influence of IT on innovation.

Another avenue for adding to research on IT and innovation can be inferred from a review of the innovation litera-

ture as presented by Jha and Bose (2016) and Kohli and Melville (2019). Existing IS literature in innovation often over-

looks the concept of affordances. This is a limitation in the extant research as affordances have been argued to be a

promising lens to study innovation (Nambisan et al., 2017). Affordance theory captures what the IT in organisations allows

the human users to do (Yoo et al., 2012) and it should be investigated extensively in research on IT and innovation.

In summary, our paper has two motivations. The first is the observation that IT and innovation have a nonlinear

relationship, yet few quantitative empirical studies investigate the nonlinear nature of this relationship. The second

is that the concept of IT affordances, purported to be a promising lens to study innovation, has found limited applica-

tion in research on IT and innovation. This lacuna is illustrated in the recently published state-of-the-art handbook of

digital innovation, with contributions from top digital innovation scholars (Nambisan et al., 2020). This handbook

contains few studies directly dealing with nonlinearity or involving IT affordances.

However, our investigations into such nonlinearity are contingent upon our conceptualisation of organisational

IT. In this study, we conceptualise organisational IT in terms of IT affordances, specifically in terms of harmonious IT

affordance (HITA) (Chatterjee et al., 2020). HITA builds upon the concept of IT affordances (Markus & Silver, 2008)

and uses the concept of covariance fit (Venkatraman, 1989) to understand how well organisational IT affordances work

together
to
produce
desirable
outcomes
such
as
innovation.
There
are
two
justifications
for
adopting
HITA

(as representing organisational IT) for nonlinear theorisation. The first justification relates to the fact that HITA is con-

ceptualised as a fit (specifically a covariance fit), particularly as a measure of congruence between organisational com-

ponents (Venkatraman, 1989). It has been clearly observed in the existing literature that linear theorisation is

inappropriate when concepts or theories explicating congruence are investigated (Yang et al., 2013), because linear

models tend to oversimplify the complex nuances of joint effects of multiple factors (eg, situations when we consider a

fit between these factors) (Venkatesh & Goyal, 2010). That is, it can be argued that when researchers need to engage

in nonlinear theorisation, it is useful to consider a construct that demands nonlinear theorisation
—
such as a fit-based

construct like HITA. Consequently, using HITA a fit-based construct addresses the need for nonlinear theorisation.

The second justification for adopting HITA for nonlinear theorisation is that HITA is conceived as a superordi-

nate organisational IT affordance. The affordance lens is useful for investigating
emergent
outcomes in IT-enabled

organisations (Benbya et al., 2020), because it is intrinsically relational, embodying the relationships between users

and the technologies they use, adapt or appropriate for their work. These relationships are often recalibrated as

users adjust their behaviours related to IT appropriation and use (Benlian, 2015). For example, users can become

increasingly better at appropriating an IT, and thus the level of affordance that the IT provides can increase quickly.

Affordances can therefore emerge over time through adaptive alignments and configurations between organisational

components
(Benbya
&
Leidner,
2018)-thus
the
affordance
lens
is
suitable
to
study
complex
and
dynamic

(ie, nonlinear) interactions (Nambisan et al., 2017).

In summary, HITA as a fit-based construct demands nonlinear theorisation, and HITA, by also being an

affordance, paves the way for nonlinear theorisation. Thus, it is an appropriate theoretical anchor for our nonlinear

investigation of IT-enabled innovation. Based on our discussion, we investigate the following research question:

RQ: What is the nature of the nonlinear influence of HITA (representing organisational IT) on

organisational innovation?

An important contribution of our study is the ability to accommodate the possibilities of both alignment and

misalignment between IT affordances and show how they can both be useful to innovation. We show that

organisational IT
—
captured as a coalignment of IT affordances (ie, HITA)
—
can lead to innovation in quite differ-

ent ways, through convergence and synergy when they are aligned, or through divergence and creative tension,

when they are misaligned. Both possibilities are crucial to understand the nonlinear relation between IT and

innovation.

Our study also highlights that innovation is most inhibited when the IT affordances are largely independent of

each other, and the resultant covariance fit between them (ie, HITA) is zero. In this situation, the IT affordances are

neither convergent nor divergent. We find that innovation cannot occur when IT affordances are independent, which

is another insight of our study.

Before proceeding, we offer two clarifications. First, we clarify the scope of the study (Suddaby, 2010). This

research focuses on the HITA
à
innovation link; thus, we are concerned only with these two core factors. The

innovation of the IT itself, such as the development of new IT products or IT services, is beyond the scope of our

paper. In addition, although other organisational factors
—
such as organisational culture and leadership
—
are valuable

in studies of innovation, these factors lie outside our scope. Furthermore, we do not examine innovation
processes

but only innovation
outcomes
, such as novel products or services. Our paper thus focuses only on the
nonlinear

relationship between HITA and innovation outcomes.

We should also clarify that our nonlinear theorisation is informed by our choice of HITA as the central IT artefact

in an organisation. Alternate concepts of the central IT artefact in an organisation exist
−
such as dynamic IT capability

(eg, Li & Chan, 2019). Such conceptualisations of organisational IT can lead to different theorisations of the effect of

IT on innovation. Ours is one possible way to look at the nature of the relationship between IT and innovation.

We invite our colleagues to present alternate conceptualisations of organisational IT, which can extend, modify or

critique the views presented in this study.


Understanding HITA requires an elaboration of the concept of IT affordances. IT affordances situate organisational

IT within a sociotechnical space, because IT in organisations is intricately linked to the social actors (eg, users) in an

organisation (Sarker et al., 2019). In IS research, one of the most promising sociotechnical perspectives on IT is the

concept of IT affordances (Zammuto et al., 2007). Discussing digital innovation in their editorial, Nambisan

et al. (2017) noted the suitability of the affordance perspective to study innovation:

Technology affordances
...
theory
...
offers a promising lens that is particularly well suited to help IS

scholars build new theories in this regard [ie, for innovation] (p. 230).

Formally, an
IT affordance
represents
“
the possibilities for goal-oriented action afforded to specified user groups

by technical objects
”
(Markus & Silver, 2008, p. 622). The concept of IT affordances lends insight into what IT allows

the organisational users to do, in terms of achieving organisational goals and objectives (Yoo, 2010). Affordances go

beyond the intrinsic features offered by technology; they also include the ways in which the social elements of an

organisation can be arranged in relation to organisational IT (or vice versa) to give rise to new possibilities of action

(Leonardi, 2011). Affordances are, therefore,
sociotechnical
structures, in which social and technical elements are

related and conjoin to produce outcomes (Robey et al., 2013).

We follow the relational view of affordances, which is the most prominent in IS literature. Drawing upon the

work of Cousins and Robey (2015), we can understand affordances (in the relational view) as
“
action possibilities

emerging from the relationship between actors and technology
”
(Cousins & Robey, 2015, p. 35), such as,
“
between

users' abilities and features of
...
technology
”
(Cousins & Robey, 2015, p. 34). Further, the relational view suggests

“
[an] affordance to be consistent with a relational ontology due to its dependence on the relationship between mate-

rial objects and human actors
”
(Robey et al., 2013, p. 386). The relational view of affordances has also found favour

with other authors who write:

The most nuanced writings on the relationship between technology and organisational change

emphasize the
relational character of affordances
. In this view, affordances are not exclusively prop-

erties of people or of artifacts
—
they are constituted in relationships between people and the material-

ity [technological features] of the things with which they come in contact (Treem & Leonardi, 2013,

p. 146, emphasis added in bold).

To summarise, the notion of affordances we subscribe to is rooted in a relational ontology where affordances

allow users certain actions, given the user characteristics (such as abilities and goals) and the technological features.

For example, a 3D visualisation feature offered by the technology could result in an aesthetic affordance or an

affordance of geometric accuracy, depending upon the goals and abilities of the user (Carlo et al., 2012).

The relational view of affordances has multiple advantages. One advantage is that the relational view allows

users to appreciate the malleability of IT and the possibility of appropriating IT according to user needs (DeSanctis &

Poole, 1994; Hardin et al., 2014). Another advantage of the relational view is that, even if technologies change, the

affordances can remain the same:
“
defining affordances as relationships averts the need to specify affordances in

terms of a potentially limitless set of material properties
”
(Cousins & Robey, 2015, p. 38). Finally, the relational view

of affordances is most consistent with the sociotechnical approach (Robey et al., 2013). Thus, by embracing the rela-

tional view of affordances, we also stay true to the sociotechnical viewpoint that underpins this study.

It is also important to note that extant research has elaborated upon both enabling and constraining perspectives

when discussing affordances. For example, Leonardi (2011) suggests that affordances are enabling and distinguishes

them from the idea of constraints, which are the opposite of affordances and can be viewed as impediments. In con-

trast to Leonardi, other studies have conceptualised affordances to be both enabling and constraining (eg, Volkoff &

Strong, 2018). In our study, we found it useful to differentiate between affordances and constraints, and following

Leonardi's work, treat the former as enablers and the latter as impediments.

Three salient IT affordances in an organisation

We consider three fundamental IT affordances for the purpose of our study. They are collaborative IT affordance,

organisational memory affordance and process management affordance. According to Chatterjee et al. (2015)
, collabora-

tive affordance
captures how IT allows (
“
affords
”
) collaborative acts within an organisation in both collocated and virtual

settings.
Organisational memory affordance
captures how IT allows the facilitation of management, application and exploi-

tation of organisational knowledge (Chatterjee et al., 2015). Finally, process
management affordance
reflects how


organisational IT allows developing and managing work processes, as well as resource management, to enable decision-

making and action (Chatterjee et al., 2015).

The focus on these three affordances follows from prior work on delineating IT affordances for an organisation.

The arguments for focusing on these three affordances are elaborated in Chatterjee et al. (2015), who in turn

develop their arguments based upon prominent works on affordances (eg, Zammuto et al., 2007), communities of

practice (eg, Wenger et al., 2002) and organisational theory (Brown & Starkey, 2000). In their study, Chatterjee

et al. (2015) observe that organisations can be likened to communities of practice (COPs) and that COPs have three

fundamental characteristics: existence of a knowledge domain within the COP for capturing collective learning, exis-

tence of collaborative mechanisms that support collective learning and the existence of knowledge generating and

knowledge creating processes within the COP.

Based upon an understanding of the COP literature, we can infer that an effective presence of IT within the

COP will require it to support (
“
afford
”
) the existence of a knowledge domain, the existence of collaborative mecha-

nisms and the existence of effective processes for coordinating and controlling resources. This inference leads us to

identify the three fundamental affordances we use in this paper: organisational memory affordance supporting the

existence of the knowledge domain, collaborative affordance supporting the existence of collaborative mechanisms

to facilitate collective learning and process management affordance supporting the existence of coordinating and

controlling organisational resources.

HITA

Building upon an understanding of the three affordances discussed in the previous section, Chatterjee et al. (2020)

developed the concept of HITA as a superordinate IT affordance of an organisation.
4
This superordinate IT affordance

was defined as an
“
IT affordance provided by the organisational IT through a harmonious coalignment of the three

lower-level affordances of collaboration, organisational memory, and process management
”
(Chatterjee et al., 2020,

p. 7). HITA is understood as a second-order construct and reflects a fit between three primary affordances that an orga-

nisation can have (Chatterjee et al., 2020). The key idea of HITA is that the three individual IT affordances are not

orthogonal; they can build upon and reinforce each other. When this reinforcement happens, it reflects the mutual

coalignment between these affordances. That is, HITA captures the synergistic, higher-level working together of the

three affordances (Chatterjee et al., 2020) and is a way to understand the overall IT wherewithal of the organisation.

Beyond the arguments offered by Chatterjee et al. (2020), HITA can also be understood using the metaphor of

resonance from physics.
Resonance
is based on the idea that objects have a natural frequency of vibration that, when

reinforced, creates an amplifying effect. A common application of this effect is the design of acoustic string instru-

ments with a hollow wooden base that amplifies the sound (eg, the guitar). We propose that when IT affordances

are aligned, they generate a similar resonating effect for the organisation, as captured by HITA. As an example of this

resonance, we can consider the collaborative affordance that facilitates knowledge transfers and thus helps the

organisational memory affordance (Chatterjee et al., 2020). Conversely, the organisational memory affordance can

serve as a repository of past experiences in the organisation. These past organisational experiences captured in the

organisational memory can serve to improve reflections and deliberations in virtual (collaborative) meetings. Thus,

the organisational memory affordance can improve the collaborative affordance.

The value of the conception of HITA to study organisations is highlighted by the long-standing argument that it

is beneficial to understand the level of integration across varying organisational IT-related components (Nazir &

Pinsonneault, 2012). Formally,
integration
in an organisational context reflects
“
the extent to which different

[organisational] systems are interconnected and can talk to one another
”
and
“
the extent to which distinct and

interdependent organisational components constitute a unified whole
”
(Barki & Pinsonneault, 2005, p. 166). Namely,

effective integration presupposes an alignment of organisational components and this alignment is captured by

HITA. Notably, the organisational components are not restricted to a certain category: they can be technology,

CHATTERJEE
ET AL

299

people, processes or even the relations between them (Barki & Pinsonneault, 2005). Therefore, an integration of

aligned IT affordances can be logically captured by HITA.

T H E O R Y D E V E L O P M E N T

Figure 1 depicts our theoretical model and captures our proposed nonlinear (quadratic) influence of HITA on innova-

tion. A quadratic relationship can be graphically represented by a U-shaped (or an inverted U-shaped) curve (Haans

et al., 2016). Specifically, an X
à
Y, U-shaped relationship occurs when we demonstrate the following logic: (a) X is an

antecedent of Y; (b) when X increases to the right of the Y vertex (the lowest point of Y), Y increases at an increasing

rate and (c) when X decreases to the left of the Y vertex, Y still increases at an increasing rate (Haans et al., 2016).

Consequently, our hypothesis
—
that HITA has a U-shaped effect on innovation (ie, the dotted line in Figure 1)
—

follows from three fundamental propositions: (a) HITA is an antecedent of innovation; (b) when HITA increases to

the right of the innovation vertex, innovation increases at an increasing rate and (c) when HITA decreases to the left

of the innovation vertex, innovation still increases at an increasing rate. The development of these three propositions

requires that we first clarify the existence and nature of a vertex for innovation. The vertex for innovation is crucial

because it represents the turning point of a U-shaped curve (Haans et al., 2016).

3.1

Existence of a vertex (minima) for innovation: the notion of organisational inertia

The presence of a vertex (minima) for innovation indicates that most of the organisational work involves only

“
a minimal core of required tasks and responsibilities
”
(Nijssen & Paauwe, 2012, p. 3322); that is, the organisation
“
is

doing the minimum in terms of competitive response
”
(Gresov et al., 1993, p. 192). Thus, an organisation at the inno-

vation vertex occupies a state in which it merely has a presence in the market but is neither acquiring new knowl-

edge and resources nor enhancing its existing capabilities for innovation (Grewal et al., 2001). In essence, at the

innovation vertex, an organisations uses its minimum innovation potential (Gresov et al., 1993).

Drawing on the organisational inertia literature (eg, Kelly & Amburgey, 1991), we propose that the vertex

for innovation can be interpreted as an example of organisational inertia.
Organisational inertia
is formally defined as

the
“
limitations on the ability of organisations to adapt
”
(Hannan & Freeman, 1977, p. 930). The theory of

organisational inertia posits that
“
organisational inertia is manifested in structural resistance against fundamental

reorganisations
”
(Péli, 2009, p. 344). A key characteristic of organisational inertia is that change is initially resisted;

however, if changes do occur, they are often cascading (Barnett & Pontikes, 2008; Yi et al., 2016). The work of Yi


et al. (2016) support the argument that moving away from organisational inertia creates rapid changes, regardless of

the direction of movement away from inertia:

First, inertia slows down changes to the [organisational] routines. Second, such reduced rates of

routine-level changes lead to unintended variation in the pace and sequence of their implementation,

and thus feedback. Last, such unintended variation caused by temporal reordering may generate

unanticipated consequences (eg, a cascade of changes) that are selectively retained in subsequent

organisational adaptation (p. 790).

To elaborate the contention in this quote, Yi et al. (2016) develop a simple model. In their model, inertia leads to

two primary outcomes: retention and delays in implementation. Retention can cause what they call
“
useful variations
”

as
well
as
“
detrimental
variations
”
ultimately
leading
to
reordering
of
planned
changes
and
thus
increased

organisational adaptation (eg, to innovation). Delays in implementation also lead to reordering of planned changes.

Ultimately, inertia stimulates organisational adaptation and thus change, which is a counterintuitive but useful insight.

In our conception, innovation is minimal when HITA is close to zero. HITA close to zero reflects the fact that the

IT affordances of collaboration, organisational memory and process management are practically orthogonal to each

other. That is, they are unrelated
—
neither reinforcing each other (positive HITA) nor impeding each other (negative

HITA). We propose that in order for innovation to happen, IT affordances should either reinforce (positive HITA) or

impede (negative HITA) each other and that innovation is hampered when they are orthogonal to each other (ie,

HITA close to zero). In fact, the innovation vertex reflects the highest point of organisational inertia (lowest innova-

tion point), and this is due to the IT affordances neither impeding nor reinforcing each other
—
as a result, the organi-

sation neither has synergy (positive HITA) nor any creative tension (negative HITA) to leverage. Following the logic

of Yi et al. (2016), if the organisation moves away from inertia (where HITA is close to zero), it implies that HITA

either becomes negative or positive. In both these situations, swift changes occur, which in our context can be inter-

preted to be a rapid effect on innovation.

Two other concepts related to inertia become important to our theorisation. They are the ideas of integration

and paradox. At the outset, the ideas of integration, inertia and paradox are from three different literature streams.

The logic of integration-briefly noted earlier
−
follows from contingency theory, which notes that greater fit between

organisational components leads to desired outcomes (Smith & Lewis, 2011). The concept of paradox in organisa-

tions highlights that there are many contradictions within organisations and organisations either accept these contra-

dictions or resolve them in some way to continue towards their desired goals (Battilana et al., 2015). Often

organisations
“
sensemake
”
about the paradox and modify organisational logic (Jay, 2013) by taking strategic deci-

sions to reap advantage of the paradoxes (Smith, 2014).

Within the scope of our theorisation, inertia, integration and paradox represent distinct positions of our U-

shaped curve. The organisational inertia is represented by the vertex of our U-shaped curve. Conceptually at this

point the organisations do not want to change, innovation is at its lowest point and HITA is close to zero. The right

side of the vertex represents the logic of integration, where the greater fit (high positive HITA) fuels innovation, as

proposed by contingency theory. The left side of the vertex represents the idea of paradox, where HITA is increas-

ingly negative. This means that the IT affordances are impeding each other. Thus, they are interdependent but also

contradictory. In this stage organisations get creative about managing such contradictions. This discussion sets the

stage for developing the logics necessary to establish that the HITA
à
innovation link is U-shaped.

HITA as an antecedent to innovation

From an IS perspective, innovation happens when human agents use IT to enrich or create new organisational

resources
that
help
the
organisation
create
new
products
or
services
(Chatterjee
et
al.,
2020).

organisational outcomes emerge from how human beings use the IT at their disposal (Dewett & Jones, 2001). There

is evidence that in the current era of increasing reliance on technology, innovation is IT dependent (Drnevich &

Croson, 2013; Forman et al., 2014; Yoo et al., 2012). The increasingly prominent theme of digital innovation, defined

as the use of digital technology to innovate, highlights how innovation has been radically affected by IT:

Digital innovation has radically changed the nature and structure of new products and services,

spawned novel value creation and value appropriation pathways, enabled innovation collectives that

involve dynamic sets of actors with diverse goals and capabilities
...
(Nambisan et al., 2017, p. 223).

IT affordances can arguably be used to decipher the role of IT in innovation (Chatterjee et al., 2015; Nambisan

et al., 2017). The conception of HITA becomes especially important in this regard. HITA reflects the degree of convergence

among the individual IT affordances (Yoo et al., 2012), which are often intricately interrelated (de Vaujany & Vaast, 2013)

and thereby create an overall organisational IT bricolage (Perkmann & Spicer, 2014). HITA, therefore, represents an organisa-

tion's focal IT affordance. This focal IT affordance can be considered to be the central IT artefact in an organisation

(Sandberg et al., 2014), serving to produce higher-level functional goals (Burton-Jones & Grange, 2013), such as innovation.

Given that HITA captures the fundamental salience of IT in an organisation, it can be argued that HITA has an

important influence on organisational innovation. Specifically, if innovation is dependent upon IT and the salience of

IT to an organisation is best captured by HITA (Chatterjee et al., 2020), then it logically follows that HITA influences

innovation. Therefore,

Proposition 1
HITA is an antecedent to innovation
.

The HITA
à
Innovation relation when HITA increases to the right of the

innovation vertex

Based on our arguments, at the innovation vertex, the organisation has a high degree of inertia. We propose that as

HITA moves beyond this point to the right, it creates a self-cascading effect that rapidly bolsters innovation. This is

consistent with the idea that as organisations move away from inertia, they rapidly accrue capabilities to act flexibly

(Nadkarni & Herrmann, 2010). In fact, the existence of this
“
inertia
...
may engender potentially useful
variation
in the

process of organisational adaptation
”
(Yi et al., 2016, p. 782, emphasis added). Thus, once an organisation moves away

from inertia, it progressively adapts and accrues resources, building outcomes in an increasing manner.

This move to the right
—
away from organisational inertia
—
can be understood as synergy, which is especially useful

when interpreting the nature of the nonlinear relation between HITA and innovation. In a
synergistic relationship
,
“
the whole

is not just the sum of the parts; the system itself can be explained only as a totality
”
(Kast & Rosenzweig, 1972, p. 450), and

synergy is achieved between organisational components when they are complementary (Rehm & Goel, 2017). Seminal stud-

ies of the logic of complementarity (Milgrom & Roberts, 1990, 1995) have emphasised that coordination between comple-

mentary organisational elements results in supermodular benefits
—
that is, the alignment of organisational components

yields greater benefits than when the elements operate in silos (Milgrom & Roberts, 1990). Specifically, when organisational

elements are complementary, increasing one of them increases the influence of the others (Milgrom & Roberts, 1995).

A complementary set of IT affordances constitutes a technological ecosystem (Chatterjee et al., 2020). Such eco-

systems
harness
these
complementary
affordances,
build
on
the
synergy
they
cocreate,
and
encourage
new

ventures into innovation (Autio et al., 2018). Notably, innovation ecosystems are based on symbiotic relationships

(Autio & Thomas, 2014), and in technology-based innovation ecosystems,
“
it tends to be innovation that exploits
...

[the] complementarity
”
in technological ecosystems (Autio et al., 2018, p. 91). The effects and value of a technological

ecosystem thus depend on the extent to which its subcomponents are complementary and thus synergistic (Thomas

et al., 2014). Thus, as a fit-based construct, HITA operates according to the logic of complementarity that creates a

302
CHATTERJEE
ET AL
.



synergistic ecosystem (Fichman & Nambisan, 2009). It has been asserted that this logic of complementarity or fit

explains why some organisations successfully engage in digital innovation and others do not (Nambisan, 2013).

Interpreting the concepts of complementarity, fit and synergy in our context, we argue that individual IT

affordances should not be considered merely additive or even independent
—
because when they coalign, they

complement each other and thus generate a powerful synergistic or resonating effect. Thus, when HITA

increases
beyond
the
innovation
vertex,
it
has
a
cascading
effect
on
innovation.
For
example,
business

analytics
—
crucial to achieving rapid innovation
—
are outcomes of configuring the complementary affordances of

descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics offered by mutually interacting tools and technologies (Wang

et al., 2020). Crucially, configuring these complementary affordances has a
cascading
effect on organisational

outcomes (Nan, 2011).

Our proposition is that cultivating the positive coalignment of the three IT affordances (as reflected by increas-

ing HITA beyond the innovation vertex) provides for continuous and flexible structural recombination of the social

and technological aspects of an organisation, which in turn create, sustain and multiply positive organisational syn-

ergy (Karim & Kaul, 2015) by building mutual reinforcement and harmony in the organisation (Miron-Spektor &

Beenen, 2015). For example, the collaborative affordance improves knowledge transfer and increases organisational

memory, and the organisational memory affordance in turn facilitates collaboration. Each of the three affordances

furthers the development of the other two, leading to a virtuous, resonating phase (Miron-Spektor et al., 2011) that

increasingly bolsters the organisation's innovative orientation (Akgün et al., 2014).

When the lower-order IT affordances work together, the organisation emerges from innovation inertia by integrat-

ing these complementary affordances in a synergistic manner (Capron & Mitchell, 2009). This integration creates posi-

tive knowledge synergies, which are critical to innovation (Wu & Hu, 2012). This process occurs as a result of the

convergence of organisational routines that operate on the basis of such complementarity and ultimately foster knowl-

edge processes and practices crucial to innovation (B. B. Nielsen, 2010). In fact, it is notable that when positive covari-

ance is achieved by effectively coaligning varying IT affordances, success in developing and marketing new products

increases at an increasing rate (Millson, 2015). That is, combined organisational functions allow for cascading innova-

tion dynamics to emerge for innovation in terms of the creation of new products and services (Garud et al., 2011).

Thus, we propose that HITA has a cascading effect on innovation to the right side of the innovation vertex.

For example, if the collaborative affordance aligns with the organisational memory affordance, the units of the

organisation can collaborate and build a shareable knowledge base effectively, resulting in cross-unit synergy

(Tanriverdi, 2006). This synergy is crucial for mutual augmentation and better identification of opportunities for deliver-

ing new products and services (Nevo & Wade, 2010). HITA is thus a means of leveraging structural recombination and

reuse of organisational elements, and this leveraging often follows a synergistic path (Karim & Kaul, 2015).

Combining our discussion, we propose that increasing HITA beyond the innovation vertex facilitates a rapid

increase of innovation. Therefore:

Proposition 2
As HITA increases beyond the innovation vertex, innovation increases at an increasing rate
.

3.4

The HITA
à
Innovation relation when HITA decreases beyond the innovation

vertex

Decreasing HITA beyond the innovation vertex indicates that the individual IT affordances become increasingly mis-

aligned and their covariance ultimately negative. Misalignment between the IT affordances
—
reflected by decreasing

and ultimately negative HITA
—
indicates that the IT affordances are impeding each other instead of working together.

Multiple examples of such a situation could be imagined. For example, problems may arise when an organisation

acquires a new collaboration tool that makes it difficult to feed collaborative meeting minutes into the existing IT

that manages organisational memory (McElheran, 2015; Polites & Karahanna, 2013).

Based upon our discussion presented in the section on organisational inertia, we propose that if HITA decreases

beyond the innovation vertex (and becomes negative), innovation still increases at an increasing rate. Why would this

happen? We theorise that it occurs because the continuous lowering of HITA beyond the vertex elicits a positive

organisational reaction in terms of changing routines, business models or organisational structure that in turn posi-

tively affect innovation. Based on our earlier argument that organisations tend to change rapidly when they move

away from inertia, we theorise that rapid and positive changes can occur when organisational IT affordances become

increasingly misaligned.

In a sense, this increasing misalignment reflects a growing tension between the three IT affordances. However,

although tension is often considered detrimental to organisations, newer conceptions of organisational change have

recognised that tension can be creative as well (Bagozzi, 2011). These theories propose that organisations should try

to keep creative tensions alive (Ashforth et al., 2014) and should actively leverage constraints and tensions to

produce creative outcomes such as innovation (Smith, 2014).

The
paradox theory of innovation
we referred to earlier (Raisch et al., 2018; Schad et al., 2016; Smith &

Lewis, 2011) offers a powerful explanation of why organisations are successful even in the presence of increasing

misalignment and tensions. We leverage this theory to explain why increasing misalignment between the individual

IT affordances can continue to produce increasing innovation.
Paradox
“
denotes a persistent tension between

interdependent [organisational] elements
”
(Raisch et al., 2018, p. 1509). In our context, the paradoxical relationship

is between the three interrelated organisational IT affordances as they progressively misalign, lowering HITA beyond

the innovation vertex into the range of negative values.

The paradox theory of innovation details varying responses that organisations undertake to manage such para-

doxes (Poole & Van de Ven, 1989). The approach known as the acceptance and resolution strategy is one of the

most powerful ways to manage paradoxes (Smith & Lewis, 2011). Acceptance implies that the paradox is regarded as

an opportunity for creativity (Smith & Lewis, 2011). Paradoxes frequently result in the emergence of creative leaps

and new ideas, because they force organisations to creatively reconcile contradictory forces (Mirvis, 1998). For

example, misalignment of the IT affordances could be understood as a constraint against standardisation and homog-

enisation, but it could equally be viewed as providing opportunities for further negotiation and exploration

(Volkoff & Strong, 2013) by actively promoting the creative recombination of disparate structures, routines, technol-

ogies or processes by which novel outcomes continue to be generated (King, 2011). Such actions continue to be

“
generative [in producing outcomes] when the
...
dissonance [exhibited as lower HITA] is actively leveraged to pro-

duce innovative synergies
”
(Barrett et al., 2016, p. 718).

Fundamentally, organisations often work through a paradox by using it to stimulate further sensemaking

(Lüscher & Lewis, 2008). This sensemaking allows them to find new ways to leverage creative tensions, such as by a

repeated reframing of the organisational IT scaffolding that leads to breakthroughs and novel outcomes (Majchrzak

et al., 2011). Essentially, organisations devise creative strategies (Hargrave & Van De Ven, 2006) such as modifying

existing business models, to find synergies within the existing paradoxes and convert the paradoxes into a virtuous

cycle of success and innovation (Smith & Lewis, 2011).

The
capacity
of
organisations
to
proactively
manage
paradoxes
to
generate
synergies
was
thoroughly

described by Jay (2013), who noted that through strategic responses such as compromise, defiance and manipula-

tion, organisations leverage tensions to yield continuously innovative outcomes. Jay explained that paradox is, in

fact, a stimulator of innovation. Notably, the more paradox there is in an organisation, the greater the opportunity

exists to leverage this paradox to generate synergy (Shaver, 2006). This conclusion was echoed by Dooley (1997,

p. 85), who noted that
“
that conflicts
...
are the fodder of organisational creativity [and thus innovation].
”
Just as

other increasing misalignments in the organisation can be converted to virtuous cycles of innovation synergies

(Smith & Lewis,
2011), increasing misalignments between IT affordances can be creatively converted into

innovation synergies as well.

Beyond the notion of paradox, two separate arguments also support our contention that innovation rapidly

increases when HITA becomes negative.
First
, this counterintuitive idea can be forwarded only because we consider

304
CHATTERJEE
ET AL
.





HITA as a fit between the three IT affordances (collaborative, organisational memory, process management). When

HITA becomes negative, IT affordances are in negative alignment with each other. Namely, a negative fit or a misfit

between the IT affordances happens. In such cases, organisations purposefully manage and leverage this misfit

(Voelpel et al., 2006) to fuel desired outcomes such as innovation.

Second
, the conception that innovation rapidly improves when HITA is negative is reinforced by the view that

organisations are complex adaptive systems (CAS) that follow the tenets of complexity theory (Benbya et al., 2020;

Tanriverdi et al., 2010):

Complexity science theories and methods combine different epistemologies (ie, positivism, inter-

pretivism, and realism) to provide novel opportunities to question assumptions (eg, equilibrium, stabil-

ity, etc.), manage tensions and paradoxes, and rethink the way we view many sociotechnical

phenomena at the centrer of our field. Their value is particularly prominent when the research com-

munity faces new phenomena and questions that do not lend themselves well to the traditional,

reductionist approaches (Benbya et al., 2020, p. 3).

Complexity theory posits three fundamental concepts (Benbya et al., 2020, p. 9): (a)
conjunctive causation
, which

means that
“
outcomes rarely have a single cause but rather result from the interdependence of multiple conditions
”
;

(b)
equifinality
,
“
which entails more than one pathway to a given outcome
”
; and (c)
asymmetry
,
“
which implies that

attributes found to be causally related in one context may be unrelated or even inversely related in another.
”

A full discussion of complexity theory and why organisations are considered CAS are beyond the scope of our

paper. However, assuming the CAS view of organisations holds, our theorisation is consistent with the three tenets

of complexity theory. In our paper, innovation is an outcome of the interrelationships of the three IT affordances,

and these interrelationships are captured by HITA (conjunctive causation). Both positive and negative values of HITA

can influence innovation (equifinality). As both positive and negative HITA values lead to innovation, the relationship

between HITA and innovation is asymmetric.

Thus, the CAS perspective provides additional support for our theorisation. The CAS viewpoint allows us to

logically demonstrate how counterintuitive outcomes (such as HITA leading to increasing innovation even when

HITA is negative) are possible. In this perspective, if organisations recognise that there is some misfit, they change

their business models such that the preferred outcomes continue to happen (Laudien & Daxböck, 2017). For exam-

ple, an organisation that was leveraging an existing business model that used the high level of HITA to create syn-

ergy for innovation now adopts another business model that can leverage the fact that HITA is negative to still

continue to innovate. In fact, CAS views that some amount of tension is necessary to continue innovation

(Chae, 2014). In our case, the tension is between the three IT affordances and this tension is exhibited through

negative HITA.

The discussion presented in this section highlights the multiple conceptions that support the contention that

when HITA is negative (ie, to the left of the innovation vertex) innovation still happens at an increasing rate. The con-

ception of organisational paradoxes, creative tension, organisational inertia and finally, organisations as CAS, all

support the view that lower (and ultimately negative) values of HITA can still fuel innovation. Therefore, we propose:

Proposition 3
As HITA decreases beyond the innovation vertex, innovation increases at an increasing rate
.

Support for Propositions 1 through 3 leads to our hypothesis that a U-shaped curve best captures the

HITA
à
innovation relationship.
5
In a U-shaped curve, the dependent variable increases rapidly as the independent

variable moves on either side of the innovation vertex. Our three propositions capture this behaviour and therefore

we can hypothesise:

H1
HITA has a U-shaped influence on innovation
.

Collecting data via a third-party marketing research firm

We used an online survey methodology for data collection. To conduct the survey, we contracted the services of a

third-party market research firm named Centiment (https://www.centiment.co/)
−
a preferred vendor for many

universities (including the first author's).

Methods researchers have established that collecting survey data from third-party market research firms is an

effective way to gather anonymous responses (eg, Vance et al., 2013). Lowry et al. (2016) explained why this method

is efficacious for organisational research and why collecting data from third-party market research firms provides

critical benefits (see Table 1).

There are other advantages of contracting the services of third-party market research firms. These firms address

the limitations that researchers face when attempting to collect data from high-level organisational executives. Con-

tacting high-level IT and business executives in organisations and convincing them to complete a survey is challeng-

ing. These executives do not know the researchers and have no prior contact with them. Thus, any contact efforts

are likely to be ignored. Moreover, data collection in this study spanned industries and organisations across the

entire USA. If the researchers had collected data themselves, it would only have been possible to collect some data

locally, but even then, there would have been too few responses to run statistical analyses.

Third-party market research firms, although expensive, help to address these challenges systematically. Over

time, they have built up connections with organisational executives and have automatically received their permission

to be included in their data panels. Thus, they are already known to these executives. Therefore, any contact efforts

from them (as compared to the researchers) are less likely to be ignored. Finally, these market companies are set up

to collect data across vast geographical divides. For example, a market research firm based in Los Angeles could

approach and collect data from an executive in New York. This is almost impossible for the researchers to achieve.

Two studies with distinct data collections

Appendix A in Data S1 describes the survey instrument used in the current study. Measures were either directly

adopted or adapted from prior literature. Third-party market research firms require researchers to provide eligibility

criteria and a desired sample size (Hardisty & Pfeffer, 2016). Organisation-level survey research often employs an

informant strategy in which key organisational informants knowledgeable about the phenomena of interest are sur-

veyed (Zablah et al., 2012). Because innovation and IT are the focus of our study, the key informants (ie, target

subjects) needed to be highly conversant with both how IT is used in their organisation and with the nature of

innovative outcomes that their company produces using IT.

Consistent with prior research also using key informants, we conducted two studies using data collected from

two different samples. The first study used a sample of senior IT executives (holding positions of IT director and

above) who were knowledgeable about how their organisations use IT for innovation and about the innovations their

organisations were producing. The second study targeted a different sample of senior sales and business executives

(studies 1 and 2 used distinct organisations) who were familiar with how their organisations leverage IT to deliver

innovative products and services.

An a priori power analysis revealed that a sample size of 201 was needed to detect the small effect of IT on

innovation as reported by prior studies (eg, Zhu et al., 2006). To compensate for the possibility of respondent dis-

qualifications, we requested a sample size of 250 for each study with the contracted third-party market research

firm. We paid the market research company (Centiment) US$3875 for each contracted sample of 250, for a total of

US$7750 for the two studies. These contracted amounts excluded the data collected from an additional set of pilot

subjects prior to launching the final data collection.

Although we formally instructed Centiment on our criteria for sample selection, we incorporated further

screening questions in our questionnaire so that no potentially inappropriate respondents would be included in the

final sample. Table 2 summarises the screening questions.

Measurement and controls

4.4.1
|
Measuring and operationalising HITA

We modelled HITA as a second-order reflective latent variable that captures the individual IT affordances (see Appendix

C in Data S1). Consistent with Chatterjee et al. (2020), we operationalised HITA as a covariance fit, which is statistically

specified by a second-order variable that explains the underlying dimensions (Polites et al., 2012). Measures for the IT

affordances (ie, collaborative, organisational memory and process management affordances) were adopted from the

instrument developed by Chatterjee et al. (2015) and subsequently used by Chatterjee et al. (2020). Items were measured

on a standard Likert-type 7-point scale (from Strongly disagree to Strongly agree). We included an additional anchor,
“
No

Knowledge/Cannot Answer,
”
to identify any respondents who had no knowledge regarding the specific question being

asked and who may have been missed by the screening questions. No subjects selected this option.

4.4.2
|
Measuring and operationalising innovation

Innovation was measured by items in the questionnaire that captured the two salient dimensions of innovation:

exploratory
(more radical) and
exploitative
(more incremental) (Jansen et al., 2006, 2009). Evidence in the innovation

literature shows that organisations engage in both these forms of innovation (Andriopoulos & Lewis, 2009; O'Reilly &

Tushman, 2013), using either the mechanism of ambidexterity (balancing both simultaneously) or the mechanism of

punctuated equilibrium (alternating between the two) (Gupta et al., 2006). Thus, we measured both.

To operationalise innovation as a combination of exploratory and exploitative innovation, we modelled innovation as a

second-order reflective latent variable (Jarvis et al., 2003). This is consistent with prior research that has combined explor-

atory innovation and exploitative innovation into a multidimensional second-order latent variable (Kristal et al., 2010). Thus,

both exploratory and exploitative innovation were measured by reflective items, and these two first-order latent variables

were modelled as reflective indicators of the second-order innovation latent variable (see Appendix C in Data S1).

Items measuring exploratory and exploitative innovations were adapted from Jansen et al. (2009; 2006) and

measured on a Likert-type seven-point scale (Strongly disagree to Strong agree) As in the measurement of individual

IT affordances, an eighth additional anchor,
“
No Knowledge/Cannot Answer,
”
was also included to identify any

respondents who had no knowledge regarding the specific question being asked.

4.4.3
|
Control variables

Apart from the usual controls in innovation studies such as organisational size (Camisón & Villar-López, 2014), industry

type (Hsu & Chang, 2011) and attributes of the respondents (Larsen & Wetherbe, 1999), we also included technological

turbulence in the industry and industry growth rate (Zhou & Wu, 2010), and organisational ownership (Ramaswamy, 2001)

(specifically captured as domestic, international joint ventures or entirely foreign-owned). Our study included these control

variables along with other relevant demographic controls, such as respondent age, education level, tenure at organisation

and number of employees supervised. Notably, none of the control variables were significant predictors of the dependent

variable, and we omit the insignificant results from the final models to simplify their presentation.

irm informed us that they had sent the final survey to 407 IT directors, out of whom 279 responded (68.5%

STATA (version STATA/SE 14.1), a covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) tool, was used to conduct

the statistical analyses. As an initial step, convergent and discriminant validity were assessed via confirmatory factor anal-

ysis (CFA) for the first-order latent variables. Per standards recommended in the literature (eg, Bollen, 1989), the fit of the

estimated model to the data was good:

χ

/df = 1.53; CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.04; SRMR = 0.02;

CD = 0.93. Convergent validity was demonstrated by large standardised loadings for all indicators (
P
< .001) and
t
-values

that exceeded statistical significance (see Appendix A in Data S1). Convergent validity was also supported by calculating

the ratio of factor loadings to their respective SEs that exceeded
j
10.0
j
(
P
< .001) (Hair et al., 2006). We also assessed

whether model fit would improve if it were loaded onto a single factor rather than multiple factors, and as expected,

model fit declined. Finally, we found that indicators loaded more strongly on their respective latent variables than on

others. Table 3 summarises the descriptive statistics associated with the first-order latent variables.

As expected, the results show that the IT affordances are correlated. Recall that HITA is a covariance fit between

the IT affordances shown in Figure 2, which can be seen simply as a second-order reflective latent variable (Polites

et al., 2012). Just as individual items of a reflective first-order latent variable should covary, the individual IT

affordances (which can be viewed as the
“
items
”
for the second-order latent variable, HITA) should covary

(Chatterjee et al., 2020). If they did not, it would be inappropriate to combine them into HITA. Finally, possibility for

any existence of common method bias (CMB) was meticulously tested (please see Appendix B in Data S1). The

results show that CMB was not a concern in the study.

5.1
|
Assessing HITA as a covariance-based fit latent variable

As shown in Figure 2, the conceptualisation of HITA as a covariance fit was assessed using a second-order latent

variable. Specifically, the appropriateness of fit as covariance is denoted by the weight of the first-order latent vari-

ables (the individual IT affordances) forming the second-order HITA latent variable, and in turn, the assessment of

the path coefficient from HITA to innovation (Bergeron et al., 2001).

Moreover, to assess the appropriateness of the covariance fit specification, two separate models were evalu-

ated. The first model specified the three affordance latent variables as direct predictors of the innovation variable,

whereas the second model specified only the second order HITA latent variable as a direct predictor of innovation.

As summarised in Table 4, this comparative analysis reveals that model fit and explanatory power for the covariance

fit specification are superior, thus supporting fit as covariance for HITA.

Model analysis for Study 1: testing for the U-shaped relationship between HITA

Figure 3 provides a graphical view of the nonlinear structural model. As a reminder, our evaluation of Hypothesis H1

is based on support for Propositions 1-3, each of which represent a distinct component of the logic underlying the

hypothesis. To test for the U-shaped relationship of HITA to innovation, we followed the three fundamental steps

Step 2

To test for a U-shaped relationship, we evaluated whether the slope at the low end of the data (ie, the

HITA) is positive. We computed the results of Equation (2) based on the minimum and maximum for HITA, which

resulted in the following slopes. The minimum of HITA (ie, left side of the curve), is

Step 3.
The third step ensures that the turning point (ie, the vertex/minima of the U in our case) of the curve

falls within the variable range of Y (HITA). Per Haans et al. (2016), the turning point is calculated using Equation (3):

In addition to the three steps recommended in Haans et al. (2016), we conducted other tests to confirm the

U-shaped relationship. These tests specified alternate models and compared the results of these alternate models

with the quadratic (U-shaped) model. The comparative models were a purely linear model (without the squared

term), a cubic model and other nonlinear models (specifically, logarithmic and exponential.). The estimation of each

of these alternate models resulted in poorer fit, demonstrating that the quadratic (U-shaped) model was the most

appropriate.

Like the results of Study 1, those of Study 2 show that the IT affordances are correlated and indicate the

appropriateness of the covariance-based fit specification. Similar steps were taken to prevent and detect CMB as in

study 1, and the results assured us that it was not present. As in Study 1, innovation was modelled as a second order

latent variable. In addition, the results for the competing models of HITA suggest that, once again, the predictive

power and fit of the data for the covariance fit model are superior (Table 7).

Analysis of model for Study 2

Table 8 presents the results for Study 2. Figure 4 provides a corresponding graphical view of the nonlinear structural

model. Once again, we follow the three steps recommended in Haans et al. (2016) to verify the theorised U-shaped

relationship. Table 8 reports the results supporting step 1. For step 2, we report that the slope on the low (ie, left)

side of the curve is
−
1.76 and that the slope on the high (ie, right) side of the curve is 1.93; both slopes were again

significant, as is required for a U-shaped relationship (Haans et al., 2016). For the third step, we report that the

turning point is at
−
0.10 of HITA, which is well within the data range of this study. The results thus corroborate the

U-shaped nature of the HITA
à
innovation relationship for study 2 as well.

Like study 1, we tested alternate relationships between HITA and innovation: purely linear, cubic and other

nonlinear models (logarithmic and exponential). The quadratic (U-shaped) model between HITA and innovation had

the best fit statistics as compared to these alternate models.

Summary of key results

The results from Study 1 and Study 2 corroborate our
central (and only) hypothesis that the effect of HITA on

innovation is U-shaped
(
H1
). In each of the two studies, both HITA and HITA
2
had a significant positive effect on

innovation. The coexistence of a positive linear relationship and a positive squared relationship corroborates the the-

ory that a U-shaped relation exists between HITA and innovation (see Figures 3 and 4) (Haans et al., 2016).

Both studies not only corroborate H1 but also produce comparable results in terms of the variance explained in

innovation and also the respective beta coefficients. Although this does not mean our model can be universally

generalised (see Appendix E in Data S1 for challenges to generalizability), it does provide evidence that our model is

logically coherent and represents one compelling way to understand the relationship between IT and organisational

innovation. The position of the minima is similar across the samples and all the relationships, showing a powerful,

repeatable pattern. Moreover, the innovation vertices (ie, lowest points of innovation) in both studies (Figures 3 and

4) are close to the Y-axis, implying that HITA (our X variable) is close to being zero at the innovation vertex. This

finding is consistent with our earlier discussion of inertia.

Contributions to research and theory

The primary contribution of our study is demonstrating that the relationship between organisational IT and

innovation is nonlinear. Ours is one of the first studies that
explicitly
theorises the
nature
of this relationship (ie, as a

U-shaped one) and quantitatively tests the theory (see Appendix D in Data S1). This overall contribution leads to

further insights as we elaborate below.

First
, we elaborate on the nonlinear relationship between IT and innovation when IT affordances are aligned

(ie, synergistic, where HITA is
positive), or
misaligned (ie, dissonant, where HITA is
negative). Namely, the

elationship between IT and innovation is nonlinear because various states of organisational IT systems (HITA posi-

tive or HITA negative) result in innovation. This counterintuitive insight is useful because it indicates that any discus-

sion of IT and innovation must consider an organisation's IT as a portfolio or assemblage of systems, with varying

degrees of coupling, and not as a monolithic system.

Second
, we demonstrate paradoxical and synergistic reasons to explain why the IT
à
innovation relationship is

nonlinear. We show that the relationship between IT and innovation is nonlinear because different organisational

mechanisms are triggered at distinct levels of the organisational IT affordance (ie, HITA). When HITA is positive, the

organisation operates in a synergistic mode; in contrast, when HITA is negative, the organisation operates in a crea-

tive dissonance mode and displays paradoxical characteristics. Notably, the outcome of innovation is fostered in

either of these quite different modes. The finding that the relation between IT and innovation is multilayered, and

therefore nonlinear, is a notable contribution.

We also draw attention to the fact that considering HITA as the central IT artefact allows our nonlinear

theorisation. HITA is based upon the concept of fit. The notion of fit is amenable to nonlinear theorisation, because

a small change in fit between organisational factors, such as IT or business objectives, leads to large changes in

organisational
outcomes
such
as
innovation
(Oh
&
Pinsonneault,
2007).
Given
the
preponderance
of
linear

theorisation in the IS innovation literature, the nonlinearity allowed by HITA enables us to address this limitation.

Third
, our study also contributes in terms of implication(s). According to our finding, organisations focusing on

innovation need not be obsessive about the levels of IT integration (eg, forcefully making HITA >0) in order to make

organisational IT systems more monolithic. Organisations can also achieve similar innovation outcomes when the IT

systems are sufficiently misaligned but not disruptive to organisational operations. Such a lack of alignment (ie, HITA

<0) can be interpreted as the extent to which an organisation's IT portfolio is strongly modular in nature. That is,

innovation can be achieved through IT convergence or increased modularity of IT systems in organisations, provided

the organisation can leverage the appropriate business models that can take advantage of this convergence or modu-

larity. For example, an organisation in an inertial state (at the vertex where HITA = 0) can try to achieve some strate-

gic modularisation of its IT systems (thus moving to the left of the vertex) or a strategic integration of its IT systems

(thus moving to the right of the vertex). Both efforts should foster innovation. By implying that both efforts (strategic

modularisation or strategic integration of IT) lead to innovation, our study goes beyond the extant literature on IT

and innovation.

Implications for practice

The practical contributions of this research can be related to an organisation's enterprise architecture (EA). The

U-shaped relationship between HITA and innovation highlights that both positive and negative values of HITA

can lead to innovation. This insight provides practical guidance for designing, implementing and managing an

organisation's EA.

A high positive value of HITA indicates an organisational technology portfolio that is aligned. Such alignment

could be in terms of strategic objectives driving the installation of a particular technology system, as well as actual

integrations of distinct systems in terms of data-sharing, seamless portability of tasks, standardisation of technologi-

cal protocols across platforms and so forth. Similarly, misalignment (negative HITA) would indicate a technology port-

folio that has been conceived and realised as disparate and isolated, both in terms of strategic objectives and

technological integration.

Given that both positive and negative HITA can stimulate innovation, organisations need not be obsessive about

levels of integration and the achievement of a more monolithic and convergent organisational technology system.

The organisation can have a positive effect by increasing the coupling of the technological portfolio, while still

maintaining a diverse one. Consequently, some balance between alignment and misalignment of IT systems may be

desirable. From an EA perspective, this indicates the desirability of developing a portfolio of systems that have

314

ET AL
.





interoperability and standardisation but remain modular and independent. Organisational executives should pay

careful attention to this possibility.

These implications about EA in an organisation can also influence managerial decision-making. It appears that

some level of flux within the integration of an organisation's business model and technology portfolio may be condu-

cive to innovating. A lack of interoperability can create discord within an organisation that could lead to a re-evaluation

of its business model(s). Organisational executives could also look out for specific recoupling opportunities within their

technology portfolios. Thus, a strategy towards increasing alignment of technology portfolio (ie, the right side of our

U-shaped curve) could be used to support existing business models to create value. However, when the technological

portfolio includes IT systems that are not aligned (ie, the left side of our U-shaped curve) executives can develop new

business models to leverage the misalignment within their technology portfolio. Clearly, the relationship between IT

and business suggests that innovation can be achieved both through increased IT alignment to business model as well

as aligning business models to existing IT. The nuanced insights from our study can help inform organisational

decision-makers as they plan on investing in, designing and managing IT systems to support their organisation.

Limitations and future research implications

One limitation of this study is its cross-sectional nature. However, reverse causality (innovation
à
HITA) is not

theoretically meaningful here. Thus, the challenge of establishing the direction of causality through a cross-sectional

design is less prevalent in this study. However, future research should address this opportunity by using additional

techniques, such as longitudinal surveys and secondary data collection. Another limitation of this study is that we

collected the data only from organisations in the US. For improved generalizability, we urge future research to test

our theory in a cross-country context.

Our study proposes that both increasing resonance (synergy) and increasing dissonance (or discord) can provide

fruitful grounds for innovation. This finding leads to research possibilities. For example, one could investigate

whether there are boundary conditions that determine when synergy is generated or when dissonance emerges in

an IT-enabled organisation.

Another important focus of future research could be to investigate the distinct types of complementarities

between the three affordances and the effects of these complementarities on organisational outcomes, including

innovation. Although our focus in this study is on the holistic nonlinear influence of IT, teasing out the relative influ-

ence of the affordances on innovation, as well as mutual relationships between the affordances, are promising areas

of research. For example, it would be useful to investigate the situation when two affordances align with each other

while the third affordance impedes both the aligning affordances. One could imagine a situation where the collabora-

tive affordance and the process management affordance align, while the organisational memory affordance does not

align with either of the other two affordances. We feel it would be fruitful to inquire if organisations can reasonably

innovate in this situation. It is also possible that lower-order IT affordances can be meaningfully combined into other

useful second order constructs, such as organisational (IT) ambivalence. Our work is aimed to galvanise the pursuit of

these interesting questions.

Future work in IS and innovation research could also investigate the value of covariance fit and how it can guide

fruitful areas of inquiry. In our paper, the advantage of using HITA as a covariance fit is that we can accommodate

the possibilities of both alignment and misalignment and show how they can both be useful to innovation. A covari-

ance fit can assume negative values and these values can be easily interpreted as misalignments. We surmise that

other measures of fit are not as readily interpretable with negative values (eg, negative values are not meaningful

when fit is considered mediation, gestalt or profile deviation). Taking note of this advantage of covariance fit, we

urge future research to consider the advantages of covariance fit and use it to investigate other phenomena related

to IT-enabled innovation. Importantly, HITA is not the only construct that can capture the competing possibilities of

alignment and misalignment between organisational components. There could be other constructs that could also

CHATTERJEE
ET AL
.
315





build upon these ideas. Thus, our use of HITA stimulates thought on unearthing other constructs that can leverage

competing ideas such as alignment and misalignment and-on a related note-the competing ideas of synergy and

paradox as well.

Finally, our theorisation and empirical test of the U-shaped curve can serve as a template to investigate

nonlinear relationships in research. IS research would benefit from an increased attention to nonlinear investigations

and we hope that our study stimulates such research pursuits.

Our study understands the coalignment between three fundamental organisational IT affordances
—
collaboration,

organisational memory and process management
—
as a higher-level IT affordance, or HITA. We theorise that HITA

has a U-shaped influence on the organisation's innovation outcomes, and our two empirical studies corroborate our

theory. Our theorisation and empirical results indicate nonlinear, quadratic patterns of relationships between the

fundamental constructs of interest, which lend support to increasing observations in academic research that IT does

foster innovation and does so in a nonlinear, and perhaps counterintuitive, fashion.

We acknowledge that qualitative studies of IT and innovation shed some light on the nonlinear relationship between

them. However, our focus in this paper is to develop and test a nonlinear theory of IT and innovation purely in the positiv-

ist tradition, using quantitative techniques. This effort has been largely missing in the literature.
