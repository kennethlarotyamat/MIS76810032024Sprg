Hi All,

I would like to make a correct on Individual Assignment 1: the tax bracket for 35% should start with $231,251 (instead of $231,250).

I have updated the assignment sheet and the assignment page. Sorry about the error!

Once again, Individual Assignment 1 is due on February 4. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need help with the assignment.

Han-fen

Purpose
Declare variables and constants and use them in a program.
Design a decision structure to evaluate different conditions and execute different instructions accordingly.
Handle user input and show output/results properly.
Requirement
Please provide proper comments to document your code, including the following:
Authorâ€™s name
Purpose of the program
In-line comments for the statements, including the variable/constant declaration and initialization.
Please submit the .java file(s) that contains the program for solving the following question.
Write a program that computes the income tax for an individual. 
The program should ask the user to enter the amount of taxable income. If the user enters a negative number, the program should show an error message and end the program. 

The program then uses the tax bracket (as shown below) to calculate the tax amount:
    10% on taxable income from $0 to $11,000, plus
    12% on taxable income over $11,001 to $44,725, plus
    22% on taxable income over $44,726 to $95,375, plus
    24% on taxable income over $95,376 to $182,100, plus
    32% on taxable income over $182,101to $231,250, plus
    35% on taxable income over $231,251 to $578,125, plus
    37% on taxable income over $578,126 or more

The program should display the total income and the total tax due.

Note: The income and tax amount should be rounded up to the next whole number. You can use Math.ceil(number) to get the round-up number.
