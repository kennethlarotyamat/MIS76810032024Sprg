		//, and it does not return a value when it is called.
		//For example, the following method prints "Hello, World!" to the console:
		//public void printMessage() {
		//  System.out.println("Hello, World!");
		// I had to cut my nails right now because i was finding it hard to type or maybe not hard but awkward
