let's put it this way
i haven't even started
and i'm already lost

i remember downloading a modding
program for empire total war
and it was hosted on github
it actually can mod any total war game

what was it. well, i don't remember it
having a landing page
and all the details were
right there on the github repository
so i guess i don't really need a landing page
for every repository

but it was a convention established
in the first programming course i took
so i think i'll continue to do it.

I don't even know where to begin.
I'm setting up a landing page for this repository

yeah, i honestly don't even know where to begin
i think that i might get caught up
or
I might get tied down creating
this landing page.

it's kind of nice to type with a keyboard
again. i've been using speech to text
for a while.
