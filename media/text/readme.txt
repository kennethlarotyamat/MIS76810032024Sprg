what a nightmare! i just finished my last class excersize of week 5 
and it took me 8 hours to complete. and i still have an individual
assignment due, and usually these are more complex.

So basically, I moved the location of my local GitHub repository. 
I moved it from my lap-top hard drive to my
external hard drive.

So this update is being written in Eclipse, I had to change
the readme file from a .md to a .txt. It might be possible
to edit a .md file in eclipse, but for whatever reason, it wasn't 
readily apparent to me how to do so.

For whatever reason I can't edit a .md file in eclipse.

I moved the location where I keep my local GitHub files. 
I'm going to commit this and see if this worked out.

I'm really tired right now.

i have to use a different IDE

so workspace save interval in minutes. I think setting it from 5 to 1. 
from five minutes to 1 minutes is essentially the same as auto-save. right?

let's put it this way
i haven't even started
and i'm already lost

there was a reading that i kind of missed

Oracle. (1995). Documentation: The Javaâ„¢ Tutorials - 
Object-Oriented Programming Concepts. Retrieved from

i remember downloading a modding
program for empire total war
and it was hosted on github
it actually can mod any total war game

what was it. well, i don't remember it
having a landing page
and all the details were
right there on the github repository
so i guess i don't really need a landing page
for every repository

but it was a convention established
in the first programming course i took
so i think i'll continue to do it.

I don't even know where to begin.
I'm setting up a landing page for this repository

yeah, i honestly don't even know where to begin
i think that i might get caught up
or
I might get tied down creating
this landing page.

it's kind of nice to type with a keyboard
again. i've been using speech to text
for a while.
